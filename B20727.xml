         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE greateſt commotions in Kingdomes have for the moſt part beene raiſed and maintained for and about <hi>Power,</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> of the <hi>Rulers</hi> and the <hi>Ruled,</hi> together with the due bounds and limits of either: And the like hath fallen out in Churches, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to this day in the ſharpeſt contentions (though now the ſeate of the warre is changed) who ſhould bee the <hi>firſt</hi> adequate, and compleate <hi>ſubject</hi> of that <hi>Church-power,</hi> which Chriſt hath left on earth; <hi>how bounded,</hi> and <hi>to whom committed.</hi> This controverſie is in a ſpeciall manner the lot of theſe preſent times: And now that moſt parties (that can pretend any thing towards it) have in ſeverall ages had their turns &amp; viciſſitudes of ſo long a peſſeſſion of it, and their pleas for their ſeverall pretences, have beene ſo much and ſo long heard, it may wel be hoped it is neere determining; &amp; that Chriſt wil ſhortly ſettle this power upon the right heires to whom he primitively did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath it.</p>
            <p>In thoſe former darker times, this golden Ball was throwne up by the <hi>Clergy</hi> (ſo called) alone to runne for among themſelves: And as they quietly poſſeſſed the name <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, The <hi>Clergy,</hi> and of the <hi>Church,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to themſelves; ſo anſwerably all manner of intereſt in power or cogniſance of matters of the Church, was wholly left &amp; quitted to them: whilſt the <hi>People that</hi> then <hi>knew not the Law,</hi> having given up their ſoules to an implicite faith in what was to be beleeved, did much more ſuffer themſelves to be deprived of all Liberties in Church affaires. this royall donation beſtowed by Chriſt upon his Church, was taken up and And placed in ſo high thrones of Biſhops, Popes, Generall Councell, &amp;c. not onely <hi>farre above theſe things on earth,</hi> the people; but <hi>things in Heaven</hi> alſo, we meane the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Churches them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; in ſo great a remoteneſſe from the <hi>people,</hi> that the leaſt right or intereſt therein, was not ſo much as ſuſpected to belong to them. But to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe latter times, after many removalls of it downe againe, and this as the iſſue of many ſuits againe and againe renued and removed, and upon the ſentence (even of whole States) as oft reverſed. It hath now
<pb facs="tcp:196745:3"/>in theſe our dayes been brought ſo neere unto the people, that <hi>they</hi> alſo have begunne to pleade and ſue for a portion, and legacy bequeathed them in it. The <hi>Saints</hi> (in theſe knowing times) finding that the <hi>Key of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> hath ſo farre opened their hearts, that they ſee with their owne eyes into the ſubſtantialls of Godlineſse, and that through the inſtruction and guidance of their teachers, they are enabled to underſtand for themſelves ſuch other things as they are to joyne in the practiſe of. They doe therefore further (many of them) begin more then to ſuſpect, that ſome ſhare in the <hi>Key of power</hi> ſhould likewiſe appertain unto them.</p>
            <p>It was the unhappineſſe of thoſe, who firſt in theſe latter times revived this plea of the peoples right, to erre on the other extreame (as it hath ever beene the fate of truth, when it firſt ariſeth in the Church from under that long night of darknes which Antichriſtianiſme had brought upon the world to have a long ſhadow of errour to accompanie it) by laying the plea &amp; claim on their behalf unto the <hi>whole</hi> power; &amp; that the Elders ſet over them did but exerciſe that power for them, which was properly theirs, &amp; which Chriſt had (as they contended) radically and originally eſtated in the people only.</p>
            <p>But after that all titles have been pleaded, of thoſe that are content with nothing but the whole, the finall judgement and ſentence may (poſſibly) fall to be a ſutable and due proportioned <hi>diſtribution and diſperſion of this power</hi> into ſeverall intereſts, and the whole to neither part. In <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welaths,</hi> it is a <hi>Diſperſion</hi> of ſeverall portions of power and rights into ſeverall hands, joyntly to concurre and agree in acts and proceſſe of weight and moment, which cauſeth that healthfull <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and conſtitution of them, which makes them laſting &amp; preſerves their peace, when none of al ſorts find they are excluded, but as they have a ſhare of concernement, ſo that a fit mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of power or priviledge, is left and betruſted to them. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the wiſedome of the firſt Conſtitutors of Common wealths is moſt ſeen in ſuch a juſt ballancing of power &amp; priviledges, &amp; beſides alſo in ſetting the exact limits of that which is committed unto each; yea and is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired by us in this than in their other Lawes; and in experience, a cleare and diſtinct definement and confinement of all ſuch parcells of power, both for the kind and extent of them, is judged to be as eſſentially neceſſary (if not more) than what ever other ſtatutes, that ſet out the kinds and degrees of <hi>crimes</hi> or <hi>penalties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So in that <hi>Politie</hi> or Government by which Chriſt would have his <hi>chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> ordered, the right <hi>diſpoſall</hi> of the power therein (we humbly ſuppoſe) may lie in a due and proportioned <hi>allotment and diſperſion</hi> (though not in the ſame meaſure and degree) into divers hands, according unto the ſeveral concernments and intereſts that each rank in his Church may have; rather than in an intire and ſole truſt committed to any one man (though
<pb facs="tcp:196745:3"/>never ſo able) or any one ſort or kinde of men or officers, although diverſified into never ſo many ſubordinations under one another. And in like manner, wee cannot but imagine, that Chriſt hath been as exact in ſetting forth the true bounds and limits of what ever portion of power he hath imparted unto any (if wee of this age could attain rightly to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it) as hee hath been in ordering what kinde of cenſures, and for what ſinnes and what degrees of proceedings unto thoſe cenſures; which wee finde hee hath been punctuall in.</p>
            <p>Now the ſcope which this grave and judicious Author in this his Treatiſe doth purſue, is, to lay forth the juſt lines and terriers of this diviſion of <hi>Church-power,</hi> unto all the ſeverall ſubjects of it; to the end to allay the contentions now on foot, about it. And in generall hee layes this fundamentall <hi>Maxime,</hi> that holds in common true of all the particulars, to whom any portion of power can be ſuppoſed to be committed: <hi>That look what ever power or right any of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſours and ſubjects thereof may have, they have it each, alike im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly</hi> (that is, in reſpect of a mediation of <hi>delegation</hi> or <hi>depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> on each other) <hi>from Chriſt,</hi> and ſo are <hi>each, the firſt ſubjects of that power that is allotted to them.</hi> And for the particular ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects themſelves, hee follows that diviſion (in the handling of them) which the Controverſie it ſelf hath made unto his hands; To wit, <hi>1. What power each</hi> ſingle <hi>Congregation</hi> (which is indowed with a Charter to be a body-politique to Chriſt) hath granted to it to exerciſe within it ſelf: And <hi>2. What meaſure,</hi> or rather, <hi>kinde of power</hi> Chriſt hath placed in <hi>Neighbour-Churches</hi> without it, and in <hi>aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>For the firſt. As hee ſuppoſeth, each Congregation, ſuch, as to have the priviledge of injoying a <hi>Presbyterie,</hi> or company of more or leſſe Elders, proper unto it ſelf; ſo being thus Presbyterated, hee aſſerteth this incorporate body or ſociety to be the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>primary</hi> ſubject of a compleat and entire power within it ſelf over it's own members; yea, and the <hi>ſole native ſubject</hi> of the power of <hi>Ordination</hi> and <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> which is the higheſt Cenſure. And whereas this corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conſiſteth both of <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> (for as for women and children, there is a ſpeciall exception by a <hi>Statute-law</hi> of Chriſt againſt their injoyment of any part of this publique power;) His ſcopeis to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate a diſtinct and ſeverall ſhare and intereſt of power, in matters of common concernment, vouchſafed to each of theſe, and diſperſed among both, by Charter from the Lord: as in ſome of our <hi>towns corporate,</hi> to a company of <hi>Aldermen,</hi> the Rulers, and a <hi>Common-Councell,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:196745:4"/>a body of the people, there uſeth to be the like: He giving unto the <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Presbytery</hi> a binding power of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> proper and peculiar unto them; and unto the <hi>Brethren,</hi> diſtinct and apart, an intereſt of <hi>power</hi> and <hi>priviledge</hi> to concurre with them, and that ſuch affaires ſhould not be tranſacted, but with the joynt agreement of both, though out of a different right: ſo that as a Church of <hi>Brethren</hi> only, could not proceed to any publique cenſures, without they have <hi>Elders</hi> over them, ſo nor in the Church have the <hi>Elders</hi> power to cenſure without the concurrence of the people; and likewiſe ſo, as each <hi>alone</hi> hath not power of Excommunicating the whole of either, though <hi>together</hi> they have power over any particular perſon or perſons in each.</p>
            <p>And becauſe theſe particular Congregations, both <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> may diſagree and miſcarry, and abuſe this power committed to them; He therefore, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> aſſerteth an aſſociation or communion of Churches, ſending their <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> into a <hi>Synod,</hi> (ſo hee purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chooſeth to ſtile thoſe <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> of <hi>Elders</hi> which the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> do call <hi>Claſſes</hi> or <hi>Presbyteries,</hi> that ſo hee might diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from thoſe <hi>Presbyteries</hi> of <hi>Congregations</hi> before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) And acknowledgeth that it is an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Chriſt, unto whom Chriſt hath (in relation to rectifying <hi>Mal-adminiſtrations</hi> and <hi>healing diſſentions</hi> in particular <hi>Congregations,</hi> and the like caſes) commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a due and juſt meaſure of power, ſuited and proportioned to thoſe ends; and furniſhed them, not only with <hi>ability</hi> to give <hi>counſell</hi> and <hi>advice,</hi> but further upon ſuch occaſions with a <hi>Miniſteriall power</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> to <hi>determine, declare</hi> and <hi>injoyn</hi> ſuch things as may tend to the reducing ſuch <hi>Congregations</hi> to right order and peace. Onely in his bounding and defining this <hi>power,</hi> he affirms it to be. Firſt for the <hi>kinde</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> of it, but a <hi>dogmaticall</hi> or <hi>doctrinall power,</hi> (though ſtamped with authority Miniſteriall as an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of Chriſt) whether in judging of controverſies of faith (when they diſturb the peace of particular <hi>Congregations,</hi> and which themſelves finde too difficult for them) or in decerning matters of fact and what cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they doe deſerve: but not armed with authority and power of <hi>Excommunicating</hi> or <hi>delivering unto Satan,</hi> either the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations</hi> or the <hi>Members</hi> of them: But they in ſuch caſes, having decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and judged the nature of the offence, and admoniſhed the peccant <hi>Churches,</hi> and decerned what they ought to do with their offending mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; they are to leave the <hi>formall act</hi> of this cenſure to that authority which can only execute it, placed by Chriſt in thoſe <hi>Churches</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which if they deny to do, or perſiſt in their miſcarriage, then to
<pb facs="tcp:196745:4"/>determine to <hi>withdraw communion from them.</hi> And alſo for the <hi>extent</hi> of this power in ſuch <hi>Aſſemblies</hi> and <hi>Aſſociation</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> he limits and confines <hi>that</hi> alſo unto caſes, and with cautions (which will appear in the <hi>Diſcourſe</hi>) to wit, That they ſhould not intrench or impair the priviledge of intire Juriſdiction committed unto each <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> (as a liberty purchaſed them by Chriſts blood) but to leave them free to the exerciſe and uſe thereof, untill they abuſe that power, or are unable to manage it; and in that caſe only to aſſiſt, guide, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, and not take on them to adminiſter it for them, but with them, and by them.</p>
            <p>As for our ſelves, we are yet, neither afraid, nor aſhamed to make profeſſion (in the midst of all the high waves on both ſides daſhing on us) that the ſubſtance of this brief <hi>Extract</hi> from the <hi>Authors</hi> larger <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> is That very <hi>Middle-way</hi> (which in our Apologie we did in the generall intimate and intend) between that which is called <hi>Browniſme,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyteriall-government,</hi> as it is practiſed; whereof the one doth in effect put the chief (if not the whole) of the rule and government into the hands of the people, and drowns the <hi>Elders</hi> votes (who are but a few) in the major part of theirs: And the other, taking the chief and the principall parts of that rule (which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive is the due of each <hi>Congregation,</hi> the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi>) into this Juriſdiction of a common <hi>Presbyterie</hi> of ſeverall <hi>Congregations,</hi> doth thereby in like manner ſwallow up, not only the intereſts of the people, but even the votes of the <hi>Elders</hi> of that <hi>Congregation</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, in the major part thereof.</p>
            <p>Neither let it ſeeme arrogance in us, but a teſtimony rather to the truth, further to Remonſtrate, that this very <hi>Boundary platforme</hi> and <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſement</hi> of <hi>Church power,</hi> as here it is (we ſpeake for the ſubſtance of it) ſet out and ſtated; as alſo that the tenure and exerciſe thereof in all theſe ſubjects, ſhould be immediate from Chriſt unto them all, is now new unto our thoughts; yea it is no other than what our owne apprehenſions have beene moulded unto long ſince: And this many of our friends and ſome that are of a differing opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having knowne our private judgements long, as likewiſe our owne Notes and tranſcripts written long agoe, can teſtifie; beſides many publike profeſſions ſince as occaſion hath beene offered: Inſomuch as when we firſt read this of this learned Author (knowing what hath been the more generall current both of the practice and judgement of our <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> for the Congregationall way) we confeſſe we were filled with wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at that Divine hand, that had thus led the judgements (without the
<pb facs="tcp:196745:5"/>leaſt mutuall interchange or intimation of thoughts or notions in theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars) of our <hi>Brethren</hi> there, and our ſelves (unworthy to be mentioned with them) here: Onely we crave leave of the reverend Author and thoſe <hi>Brethren</hi> that had the view of it, to declare: that we aſſent not to all expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſcattered up and down, or all &amp; every Aſsertion interwoven in it; yea nor to all the grounds or allegations of Scriptures; nor ſhould wee in all things perhaps have uſed the ſame terms to expreſſe the ſame materials by.</p>
            <p>For inſtance, wee humbly conceive <hi>Prophecying</hi> (as the Scripture tearmes it) or ſpeaking to the edification of the whole Church, may (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) be performed by Brethren gifted, though not in Office as Elders of the Church; onely <hi>1</hi> Occaſionally, not in an ordinary courſe. <hi>2.</hi> By men of ſuch abilities as are fit for Office; And <hi>3.</hi> not aſsuming this of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but judged ſuch by thoſe that have the power, and ſo allowed and deſigned to it: And <hi>4.</hi> ſo as their Doctrine be ſubjected (for the <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it</hi>) in an eſpeciall manner to the <hi>Teaching Elders</hi> of that Church: And when it is thus cautioned, wee ſee no more incongruity for ſuch to ſpeake to a point of Divinity in a Congregation, then for men of like abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to ſpeake to, and debate of matters of religion in an Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which this reverend Author allows; and here, with us, is practiſed.</p>
            <p>Againe, in all humility, we yet ſee not that Aſſembly of <hi>Apoſtles, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> and <hi>Brethren, Acts 15.</hi> to have beene a <hi>formall Synod,</hi> of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, ſent, out of a ſet and combined aſſociation from neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; but an Aſſembly of the <hi>Church of Jeruſalem</hi> and of the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the <hi>Church of Antioch</hi> alone; that were farre remote each from other, and electively now met: Nor are we for the preſent convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to the end to make this a Precedent of ſuch <hi>a formal Synod,</hi> did act therein as Ordinary <hi>Elders,</hi> and not out of Apoſtolicall guidance &amp; aſſiſtance; But we rather conceive (if we would ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the mutual aſpects which theſe two Churches and their <hi>Elders</hi> ſtood in this conjunction, abſtracting from them that influence and impreſſion w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> (that ſuperior Sphere) the Apoſtles who were then preſent had in this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action) this to have been a <hi>Conſultation</hi> (as the learned Author doth alſo acknowledge it to have beene in its firſt originall, onely riſing up to be a Generall Councell by the Apoſtles preſence, they being <hi>Elders</hi> of all the Churches;) or if you will, <hi>a reference</hi> by way of <hi>Arbitration</hi> for deciding of that great controverſie riſen amongſt them at <hi>Antioch,</hi> which they found to bee too difficult for themſelves; and ſo to be a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant indeede for all ſuch waies of communion between all, or any, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially neighbour Churches; and upon like occaſions to bee Ordinances furniſhed with miniſteriall power for ſuch ends and purpoſes. Our
<pb facs="tcp:196745:5"/>reaſons for this, wee are now many waies bound up from giving the accompt of, in this way, and at this ſeaſon; But however if it ſhould have beene ſo intended as the learned Author judgeth, and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to have acted therein as ordinary <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> yet the lines of that proportion of power that could bee drawne from that pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne would extend no further then a Miniſteriall Doctrinall power, &amp;c. in ſuch Aſſemblies, which we willingly grant. And it may bee obſerved with what a wary eye and exact ayme hee takes the latitude and elevation of that power there held forth, not daring to attribute the leaſt, either for kind or degree, then what that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample warrants, which was at utmoſt but a Doctrinall decernement both of the truth of that controverſie they were conſulted in; as alſo the matter of fact in thoſe that had taught the contrary, as belyers of them and ſubverters of the faith; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo much as brandiſhing the ſword and power of Excommunication, againſt thoſe high and groſſe delinquents, or others, that ſhould not obey them by that Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>Onely in the laſt place for the further clearing the difference of the peoples intreſt (which the reverend Author uſually calleth <hi>Liberty,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Power</hi>) &amp; the <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders rule</hi> and <hi>authority</hi> (which makes that <hi>firſt diſtribution</hi> of Church power <hi>in particular Congregations</hi>) as likewiſe for the illuſtration of that other allotment of <hi>Miniſterial doctrinal power</hi> in an aſſociation or communion of Churches as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the power of <hi>Excommunication</hi> (which is <hi>the ſecond.</hi>) We take the boldnes to caſt a weake beame of our dimne light upon either of theſe; &amp; to preſent how theſe have layne ſtated in our thoughts, to this end that wee may haply prevent ſome readers miſtake, eſpecially about the former. For the firſt, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> in each Congregation, as they are uſually in the New Teſtament thus mentioned diſtinctly apart, and this when their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting together is ſpoken of, ſo they make in each congregation two diſtinct intreſts (though meeting in one Aſſembly) as the intreſt of the <hi>Common-Councell</hi> or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the people, in ſome <hi>Corporations,</hi> is diſtinct from that of the company of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen;</hi> ſo as without the conſent and concurrence of both nothing is eſteemed as a Church act. But ſo as in this company of <hi>Elders,</hi> this power is properly <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> but in the people is a <hi>priviledge</hi> or <hi>power.</hi> An apparent difference betweene theſe two is evident to us by this. That two or three or more ſelect perſons ſhould be put into an Office and betruſted with an intire intreſt of power for a multitude, to which that multitude ought (by a command from Chriſt) to bee ſubject and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient as to an ordinance to guide them in their conſent, and in whoſe ſentence the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate formall Miniſteriall act of binding or looſing ſhould conſiſt: this power muſt needs bee eſteemed and a knowledged in theſe few to have the proper notion and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Authority,</hi> in compariſon of that power (which muſt yet concurre with theirs) that is in a whole body or multitude of men, who have a greater and neerer intereſt and concernement in thoſe affaires, over which theſe few are ſet as Rulers.</p>
            <p>This difference of power doth eaſily appeare in comparing the ſeverall intereſt of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>child,</hi> in his diſpoſement of her in marriage, and her concurrence with him therein, (although we intend not the paralell between the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.)
<pb facs="tcp:196745:6"/>A <hi>virgin daughter</hi> hath a <hi>power</hi> truly and properly ſo called, <hi>yea</hi> and a power ultimately to diſſent upon an unſatisfied diſlike, yea, and it muſt be an act of her conſent, that maketh the marriage valid: But yet for her <hi>Parents</hi> to have a power to guide her in her choyce (which ſhe ought in duty to obey) and a power which muſt alſo concurre to beſtowe her, or the marriage is invalid, this (comparing her intreſt (wherein ſhe is more neerly and intimately concerned) with theirs) doth ariſe to the notion of an <hi>extrinſecall authority;</hi> whereas that power is in her is but ſimply the power of her own act, in which her own concernement which doth intreſt her free by an <hi>intrinſecall right.</hi> The like difference would appeare if we had ſeene a Governement tempered of an <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> and <hi>democracy;</hi> in which, ſuppoſe the people have a ſhare, and their actuall conſent is neceſſary to all lawes and ſentences, &amp;c. whereas a few Nobles that are ſet over them (whoſe concernement is leſſe generall) in whom the formall <hi>ſanction</hi> of all ſhould lye, in theſe it were <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> in that multitude but <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>intreſt,</hi> and ſuch an Authority is to be given to a Presbytry of <hi>Elders</hi> in a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or elſe (as wee have long ſince beene reſolved,) all that is ſaid in the New Teſtament about their <hi>Rule,</hi> and of the peoples <hi>Obedience</hi> to them, is to be look't upon but as Metaphors, and to hold no porportion with any ſubſtantiall reallity of Rule and Governement.</p>
            <p>And in this Diſtribution of power, Chriſt hath had a ſutable and due regard unto the estate and condition of his Church; as now under the New Teſtament, He hath qualified and dignified it. Vnder the Old Teſtament, it was in its infancy, but it is comparatively come forth of its nonage, &amp; growen up to a riper age (both as the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure of the Covenant of grace in difference from the old, runs in the Prophets, &amp; as <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galatians</hi> expreſſeth it.) They are therefore more generally able, if vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Saints (which is to be the ſubject matter of Churches under the N. Teſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ent) to joyn with their Guides &amp; Leaders in judging &amp; diſcerning what concernes their own &amp; their <hi>Brethrens</hi> conſciences; And therefore Chriſt hath not now lodged the ſole power of all Church matters ſolely &amp; intirely in the Churches <hi>Tutors &amp; Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors</hi> as of old when it was under age He did: But yet becauſe of their weaknes &amp; unskilfulnes (for the generality of them,) in compariſon to thoſe who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> He hath aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to give gifts unto, on purpoſe for their guidance &amp; the Government of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; He hath therefore placed a Rule and Authority in thoſe Officers over them, not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely but binding: ſo as not onely nothing (in an ordinary way of Church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment) ſhould be done without them, but not eſteemed validly done unleſſe done by them. And thus by meanes of this due and golden ballancing and poyſing of power and intereſt, Authority and Priviledge, in <hi>Elders</hi> and the <hi>Brethren,</hi> this Government might neither degenerate into Lordlyneſſe and oppreſſion in Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over the Flocke, as not having all power in their hands alone; nor yet into Anarchy and confuſion in the Flocke among themſelves; &amp; ſo as all things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to mens conſciences might be, tranſacted to common edification, &amp; ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, Let it not ſeeme a paradoxe that a <hi>Miniſteriall Doctrinall</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb facs="tcp:196745:6"/>ſhould be found ſevered from that power of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> to ſecond it, if not obeyed. Every Miniſter and Paſtour hath in himſelfe, alone, a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall Doctrinall authority over the whole Church that is his charge, and every perſon in it, to <hi>inſtruct, rebuke, exhort with all authority:</hi> By reaſon of which thoſe under him are bound to obey him in the Lord, not only <hi>vi Materiae</hi> by vertue of the matter of the commands, in that they are the commands of Chriſt (for ſo he ſhould ſpeake with no more authority then any other man, yea a <hi>Child,</hi> who ſpeaking a truth out of the word, ſhould <hi>leade us,</hi> as the prophet ſpeakes;) But further, by reaſon of that Miniſteriall authority which Chriſt hath endowed him withall, he is to be look't at by them as an Ordinance of <hi>His,</hi> over them and towards them: And yet he alone hath not the authority of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication <hi>in him,</hi> to inforce his Doctrine if any doe gaineſay it: Neither therefore is this authority (as in him conſidered) to be judged vaine and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and ineffectuall, to draw men to obedience.</p>
            <p>Neither let it ſeeme strange, that the power of this Cenſure, of cutting men off, and <hi>delivering them to Satan</hi> (in which the poſitive part <hi>(and indeed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie betwixt us &amp; others,)</hi> of <hi>Excommunication</hi> lyes) ſhould be inſeperably linked by Chriſt unto a particular Congregation, as the proper native priviledge hereof, ſo as that no Aſſembly or company of <hi>Elders</hi> juſtly preſumed and granted to be more wiſe &amp; judicious, ſhould aſſume it to themſelves, or ſever the formall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof from the particular Congregations. For though it be hard to give the reaſon of Chriſts inſtitutions. Yet there is uſually in the wayes of humane wiſedom and reaſon ſomething analogous thereunto, which may ſerve to illuſtorate, if not to juſtifie this <hi>diſperſion of intreſts:</hi> And ſo (if we miſtake not) there may be found even of this in the wiſedome of our Anceſtours, in the conſtitutions of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; <hi>The ſentencing to death</hi> of any ſubject in the Kingdome, as it is the higheſt civill puniſhment, ſo of all other the neerest and exacteſt paralell to this in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls, of cutting a ſoule off and delivering it to Satan; yet the power of this high judgement is not put into the hands of an Aſſembly of Lawyers onely, no not of all the Judges themſelves, men ſelected for wiſedome, faithfullneſſe, and gravity, who yet are by office deſigned to have an inereſt herein; But when they upon any ſpeciall Cauſe of difficulty, for councell and direction in ſuch judgements doe all meete (as ſometimes they doe): Yet they have not power to pronounce this ſentence of death upon any man without the concurrence of a Jury of his Peeres, which are of his owne ranke; and in Corporations, of ſuch as are Inhabitants of the ſame place: And with a Jury of theſe (men, of themſelves not ſuppoſed to be ſo skilfull in the Lawes, &amp;c.) two Judges, yea one, with other Juſtices on the Bench hath power to adjudge and pronounce that which all of them, and all the Lawyers in this Kingdome together, have not without a Jury. And we of this Nation uſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the care and wiſedom of our Anceſtors herein, &amp; do eſteeme this priviledge of the Subject in this particular (peculiar to our Nation) as one of the glories of our Lawes, and doe make beaſt of it as ſuch a liberty and ſecurity to each perſons life,
<pb facs="tcp:196745:7"/>as (we thinke) no Nation about us can ſhew the like. And what ſhould be the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſuch a conſtitution but this (which in the beginning we inſiſted on) the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of power into ſeverall hands, which in capitall matters, every mans tryall ſhould runne through; whereof the one ſhould have the tye of like common intreſt to oblige them unto faithfullneſſe; as the other ſhould have skill and wiſedome to guide them and direct therein.</p>
            <p>And beſids that intreſt that is in any kind of Aſſociation, fraternity, yea or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, or like wiſe, that which is from the common caſe of men alike ſubjected to an Authority ſet over them to ſentence them, there is alſo the ſpeciall advantage of an exact knowledge of the fact in the hainous circumſtances thereof, yea, and (in theſe caſes) of the ordinary converſation of the perſon offending.</p>
            <p>We need not inlarge in the application of this: Although <hi>a greater Aſſembly of Elders</hi> are to be reverenced as more wiſe and able than a <hi>few Elders</hi> with their ſingle <hi>Congregations,</hi> and accordingly may have an higher doctrinall power, (a power properly, and peculiarly ſuited to their Abilities.) in caſes of difficulty, to determine and direct Congregations in their way; yet Chriſt hath not betruſted them with that power Hee hath done the Congregations; becauſe they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted from the people: And ſo <hi>one Tribe</hi> of men concerned in all the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned reſpects <hi>is wanting,</hi> which Chriſt would have perſonally concurring, not by delegation or repreſentation alone, not to the <hi>execution</hi> only, but even to the <hi>legall ſentence</hi> alſo of <hi>cutting men off,</hi> as in the former paralell and inſtance may bee obſerved. Yea, and the higher and the greater the aſſociation of the <hi>Presbyteries</hi> are, the further are they removed from <hi>the people,</hi> and although you might have thereby a greater helpe, in that <hi>Juridicall</hi> knowledge of the <hi>Rule,</hi> to be proceeded by: yet they are in a further diſtance (and diſinabled therby) from that Preciſe <hi>practique</hi> knowledge of the <hi>Fact</hi> and frame of <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the perſon tranſgre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing. And Caſes may be as truely difficult and hard to bee decided from obſcuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and want of light into the Circumſtantiation of the Fact, and perſon: in which it was committed, and by him obſtinately perſiſted in; as of the Law it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Other conſiderations of like weight might here be added, if not for the proofe (which we do not here intend) yet the clearing of this particular; As alſo to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that <hi>that</hi> other way of proceeding by <hi>withdrawing communion</hi> is moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the relation, that by Chriſts endowment all Churches ſtand in one towards another, yea and wherein the leaſt (being a body to Chriſt) doth ſtand unto all: But we ſhould too much exceed the bounds of an Epiſtle, and too long detayne the Reader from the fruitfull and pregnant labours of the worthy Authour.</p>
            <p>The God of peace and truth, ſanctifie all the truths in it, to all thoſe holy ends (and through his grace much more) which the holy and peaceable ſpirit of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor did intend.</p>

               <p n="2">2. For the ſecond: What the keys of the kingdom of heaven be?</p>
               <p>The keys of the kingdom are the Ordinances which Chriſt hath inſtituted, to be adminiſtred in his Church; as the preaching of the Word, (which is the opening and applying of it) alſo the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of the Seals and cenſures: For by the opening and applying of theſe, both the gates of the Church here, and of heaven hereafter, are opened or ſhut to the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>And the giving of theſe keyes, implyeth, that Chriſt inveſteth thoſe to whom he giveth them, with a power to open, and ſhut the gates of both. And this power lyeth partly in their ſpirituall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling (whether it be their office, or their place and order in the Church:) and partly in the concurſe and co-operation of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt, accompanying the right diſpenſation of theſe keyes; that is, of theſe Ordinances according to his will.</p>
               <p>Moreover, theſe keys are neither Sword nor Scepter; No Sword, for they convey not civill power of bodily life and death; nor Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for they convey not Soveraigne or Legiſlative power over the Church, but ſtewardly and miniſteriall. As the key of the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> was given to <hi>Hilkiah</hi> (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 22.22.) who ſucceeded <hi>Shebna</hi> in his office; and his office was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> over the houſe, <hi>v.</hi> 15. and the ſame word over the houſe, is tranſlated ſteward in the houſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.19.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Touching the third thing, what are the acts of theſe keys?</p>
               <p>The acts of theſe keys, are ſaid here to be binding and looſing, which are not the proper acts of materiall keys; for their acts be opening and ſhutting, which argueth the keys here ſpoken of be not materiall keys, but metaphoricall; and y t being keys, they have a power alſo of opening and ſhutting: for Chriſt who hath the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power of theſe keys, hee is ſaid to have the key of <hi>David,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:196745:8"/>to open, and no man to ſhut; to ſhut, and no man to open, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. which implyeth, that theſe keys of Chriſts Kingdome, have ſuch a power of opening and ſhutting, as that they do thereby, binde and looſe, retain and remit; in opening, they looſe, and remit; in ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting they binde, and retain: which will more appeare in open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fourth point.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth point then is, What is the ſubject to be bound and looſed?</p>
               <p>The Text in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.9. ſaith, <hi>whatſoever,</hi> which reacheth not (ſo far as the Papiſts would ſtretch it) to whatſoever oathes, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, or contracts, or counſels, or lawes; as if whatſoever oathes of allegiance, covenants of leaſe or marriage, &amp;c. the Pope rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth or diſſolveth on earth, ſhould be ratified or diſſolved in heaven: No, this is not the key of the kingdome of heaven, but the key of the bottomeleſſe pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.1. But this word <hi>whatſoever,</hi> is here put in the Neuter Gender, (not in the Maſculine, <hi>whomſoever</hi>) to imply both things and perſons; Things, as ſins; Perſons, as thoſe that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. For ſo when our Saviour ſpeaketh of the ſame acts of the ſame keys (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.21.) he explaineth himſelf thus: <hi>Whoſe ſins ſoever yee remit, they are remitted, and whoſe ſins ſoever yee retain, they are retained.</hi> Whatſoever you binde on earth, is as much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as whoſe ſins ſoever you retain on earth; and whatſoever you looſe on earth, is as much as whoſe ſins ſoever you looſe on earth.</p>
               <p>Now this binding and looſing of whatſoever ſins, in whoſever commit them, is partly in the conſcience of the ſinner, and partly in his outward eſtate in the Church, which is wont to be expreſſed in other terms, either <hi>in foro interiori,</hi> or <hi>in foro exteriori.</hi> As when in the diſpenſation of the Ordinances of God, a ſinner is convinced to lie under the guilt of ſin, then his ſin is retained, his conſcience is bound under the guilt of it, and himſelf bound under ſome Church-cenſure, according to the quality and deſert of his offence; and if his ſin be the more hainous, himſelf is ſhut out from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Church: But when a ſinner repenteth of his ſin, and confeſſeth it before the Lord, and (if it be known) before his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo, and then in the miniſtery of the Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Goſpel, his ſin is remitted, and his conſcience looſed from the guilt of it, and himſelf hath open and free entrance, both unto the promiſe of the Goſpel, and into the gates of the holy communion of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:196745:9"/>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth point to be explained, is, To whom is this power of the keyes given? The Text ſaith, To thee <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Jona,</hi> whom Chriſt bleſſeth, and pronounceth bleſſed upon his holy confeſſion of Chriſt, the Sonne of the living God, and upon the ſame occaſion promiſeth both to uſe him and his confeſſion, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to lay the foundation of his Church; and alſo to give him the keys of his Church, for the well ordering and governing of it. But it hath proved abuſie Queſtion, How <hi>Peter</hi> is to be conſidered in receiving this power of the keys, whether as an Apoſtle, or as an Elder, (for an Elder alſo he was, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1.) or as a Believer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his faith before the Lord Jeſus, and his fellow Brethren. Now becauſe wee are as well ſtudious of peace, as of truth, wee will not leane to one of theſe interpretations, more than to another. Take any of them, it will not hinder our purpoſe in this enſuing Diſcourſe, though (to ſpeake ingenuouſly and without offence what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) the ſenſe of the words will be moſt full, if all the ſeverall conſiderations be taken joyntly together. Take <hi>Peter</hi> conſidered not onely as an Apoſtle, but an Elder alſo, yea, and a Beleever too, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing his faith, all may well ſtand together. For there is a different power given to all theſe, to an Apoſtle, to an Elder, to a Beleever, and <hi>Peter</hi> was all theſe, and received all the power, which was given by Chriſt to any of theſe, or to all of theſe together. For as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent Chriſt, ſo Chriſt ſent <hi>Peter</hi> (as well as any Apoſtle) <hi>cum am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitudine, &amp; plenitudine poteſtatis,</hi> (ſo far as either any Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, or the whole Church it ſelfe, was capable of it) <hi>John</hi> 20.21. So that <hi>Auſtin</hi> did not miſtake when he ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> received the keys in the name of the Church. Nevertheleſſe, wee from this place in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. will challenge no further power, either to the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, or to the Fraternitie of the Church, then is more expreſly gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them in other Scriptures. Now in other Scriptures it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; Firſt, That Chriſt gave the power of retaining or remitting of ſins (that is, the power of binding and looſing, the whole power of the keys) to all the Apoſtles as well as to <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> 20.21.23. Secondly, It appeareth alſo that the Apoſtles commended the rule and government of every particular Church to the Elders (the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery) of that Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. And therefore Chriſt gave the power of the Keys to them alſo. Thirdly, It appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth farther that Chriſt gave the power of the keys to the Body like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of the Church, even to the Fraternitie with the Presbytery.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:196745:9"/>For the Lord Jeſus communicateth the power of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, to the Apoſtles, or Elders, together with the whole Church, when they are met in his Name, and agree together in the cenſure of an offender, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17, 18. If an offender (ſaith he) neglect to heare the Church, let him be to thee as an Heathen or a Publican, that is, let him be excommunicated. Which cenſure adminiſtred by them, with the whole Church, he ratifieth with this promiſe of the power of the keys, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, whatſoever you ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever you ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> In which place, howſoever there be ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Claſſicall and Congregationall Divines, what ſhould be meant by the <hi>Church (Tell the Church)</hi> whether the Presbytery or the Congregation: yet all agree in this (and it is agreement in the truth, which wee ſeek for) That no offender is to be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, but with ſome concurſe of the Congregation, at leaſt by way 1. Of conſent to the ſentence. 2. Of actuall execution of it by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themſelves from the offender ſo convicted and cenſured. Now this conſent and concurſe of the Congregation, which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the power and validitie of the cenſure, we conceive is ſome part of the exerciſe of the power of the keys.</p>
               <p>So that when Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter, To thee will I give the keys of the kingdome of heaven:</hi> If <hi>Peter</hi> then received the whole power of the keys, then he ſtood in the roome and name of all ſuch, as have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved any part of the power of the keys, whether Apoſtles, or Elders, or Churches. Or if he ſtood in the roome of an Apoſtle onely, yet that hindreth not, but that as he there received the power of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, ſo the reſt of the Apoſtles received the ſame power, either there or elſewhere: and the Presbytery of each Church received, if not there, yet elſewhere, the power belonging to their office: and in like ſort each Church or Congregation of profeſſed Believers, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that portion alſo of Church-power which belonged to them.</p>

               <p>THe ordinary Diſtribution of the keys is wont to be thus delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. There is
<list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>clavis</hi> 1. <hi>Scientiae,</hi> A key of knowledge, and a </item>

                        <hi>clavis</hi> 2. <hi>Poteſtatis,</hi> key of power:</item>
                  </list> and the key
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:196745:10"/>of power is
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Ordinis,</hi> Either a key of order, or a key of</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Juriſdictionis,</hi> Juriſdiction.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>This diſtribution though it goe for current both amongſt Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Papiſts, yet wee crave leave to expreſſe, what in it doth not fully ſatisfie us. Foure things in it ſeeme defective to us: 1. That any key of the kingdome of heaven ſhould be left without power. For here in this diſtribution, the key of knowledge is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinguiſhed from a key of power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a reall defect in omitting an integrall part of the keys, which is that key of <hi>power</hi> or <hi>liberty,</hi> which belongeth to the <hi>Church</hi> it ſelf. But no marvell, though the Popiſh Clergie omitted it, who have oppreſſed all Church-libertie: and Proteſtant Churches, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recovered the libertie of preaching the Goſpel, and miniſtery of the Sacraments, have been well ſatisfied therewith, ſo as ſome of them have looked no farther, nor ſo much as diſcerned their defect of Church-power, or liberty due unto them in point of diſcipline: and others finding themſelves wronged in withholding a key or power, which belongs to them, have wreſted to themſelves an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due power, which belongs not to them, the key of <hi>authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is another defect in the Diſtribution, in dividing the key of order from the key of Juriſdiction: of purpoſe to make way for the power of Chancellours and Commiſſaries <hi>in foro exteriori:</hi> who though they want the key of order, (having never entred into holy orders, as they are called, or at moſt into the order of Deacons one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereof our Lord ſpake nothing touching Juriſdiction) yet they have been inveſted with Juriſdiction, yea, and more then miniſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all authoritie, even above thoſe Elders who labour in word and doctrine: By this ſacrilegious breach of order (which hath been as it were the breaking of the Files and Ranks in an Armie) Satan hath routed and ruined a great part of the libertie and puritie of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and of all the Ordinances of Chriſt in them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth defect (but yet the leaſt, which we obſerve in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution) is, that order is appropriated to the Officers of the Church onely. For though wee be far from allowing that ſacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uſurpation of the Miniſters office, which we heare of (to our griefe) to be practiſed in ſome places, that private Chriſtians ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily take upon them to preach the Goſpel publickly, and to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Sacraments: Yet we put a difference between Office and Order. Office we looke at as peculiar to thoſe, who are ſet apart for ſome peculiar function in the Church, who are either Elders or Deacons. But order (ſpeaking of Church-order properly taken) is common
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:196745:10"/>to all the members of the Church, whether Officers or private bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. There is an order as well in them that are ſubject, as in them that rule. There is a <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> as well <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The maid in <hi>Athenaeus</hi> is ſaid <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as well as her Miſtreſſe. Yet if any man be willing to make office and order aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollent, we will not contend about words, ſo there be no erroneous apprehenſion wrapt into the matter.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to ſuch a diſtribution of the keyes as is more ſuitable to Scripture phraſe. For it becomes true Iſraelites rather to ſpeak the language of Canaan, then the language of Aſhdod.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> beheld, and rejoyced to behold, how the Church of Coloſſe had received the Lord Ieſus, and walked in him; he ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth up all their Church eſtate, to wit, their beautie and power, in theſe two, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>order, Col.</hi> 2.5, 6.</p>
               <p>There is therefore a <hi>key of Faith,</hi> and a <hi>key of Order.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>key of Faith,</hi> is the ſame which the Lord Ieſus calleth the <hi>key of knowledge, Luke</hi> 11.52. and which he complaineth, the Lawyers had taken away. Now that key of knowledge Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, was ſuch, that if it had not been taken away, they that had it, had power by it to enter into the kingdom of heaven themſelves, and it may be to open the doore to others, to enter alſo. Now ſuch a knowledge, whereby a man hath power to enter into heaven, is onely faith, which is often therefore called knowledge, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.11. <hi>By the knowledge of him ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtifie many:</hi> that is, by the faith of Chriſt. And <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17.3. <hi>This is eternall life to know thee:</hi> that is, to beleeve on thee. This key therefore, the key of knowledge, (ſaving knowledge) or which is all one, the key of faith, is common to all beleevers. A faithfull ſoul knowing the Scriptures, and Chriſt in them, receiveth Chriſt, and entreth through him into the kingdom of heaven, both here, and hereafter. Here he entreth into a ſtate of grace through faith<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 4.3.</note>: and by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his faith, he entreth alſo into the fellowſhip of the Church (which is the kingdom of heaven upon earth:) and by the ſame faith, as he beleeveth to juſtification, ſo he maketh confeſſion to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is perfected in the kingdom of glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.</p>
               <p>The <hi>key of Order</hi> is the power whereby every member of the Church walketh orderly himſelf, according to his place in the Church, and helpeth his brethren, to walk orderly alſo.</p>
               <p>It was that which the Apoſtles and Elders called upon <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo to carrie himſelf before the Jews in the Temple, that he might make
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:196745:11"/>it appear to all men that he walked orderly. (<hi>Act.</hi> 21.18.24.) Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, to wit, according to the orders of the Iewiſh Church, with whom he then converſed. And it was the commandment which <hi>Paul</hi> gave to the whole Church of Theſſalonica, and to all the members of it, to <hi>withdraw themſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. This their withdrawing from him that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſorderly, was the exerciſe of their key of order. And it was a like exerciſe of the ſame key of order, when he requireth the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to warne the <hi>unruly,</hi> which is, (in the originall) the ſame word, to admoniſh the <hi>diſorderly:</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. And this key of order (to wit, order underſtood in this ſenſe) is common to all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church, whether Elders or brethren.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, of <hi>Order</hi> there be <hi>two keyes:</hi> a key of <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt:</hi> And the key of <hi>Authority</hi> or <hi>Rule.</hi> The firſt of theſe is termed in the Scriptures, <hi>Liberty:</hi> So diſtinguiſhing it from that part of <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> in the officers of the Church. We ſpeak not here of that ſpirituall liberty, whether of <hi>impunitie,</hi> whereby the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are ſet free by the blood of Chriſt from Satan, hell, bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of ſin, curſe of the Morall Law, and ſervice of the Ceremoniall Law: nor of <hi>immunitie</hi> whereby we have <hi>power to be called the ſons of God,</hi> to come boldly unto the throne of grace in prayer, and as heirs of glory, to look for our inheritance in light: but of that <hi>externall libertie,</hi> or <hi>intereſt</hi> which Chriſt alſo hath purchaſed for his people, as libertie to enter into the fellowſhip of his Church, libertie to chuſe and call well gifted men to office in that his Church: libertie to partake in Sacraments, or ſeals of the Covenant of the Churchs libertie and intereſt to joyn with officers in the due cenſure of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, and the like. This libertie and the acts thereof, are often exemplified in the Acts of the Apoſtles: and the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it expreſly by the name of libertie. <hi>Brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you have been called unto</hi> LIBERTY, <hi>onely uſe not your liberty as an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another.</hi> Galath. 5.13. that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle by that libertie meaneth Church libertie or power in order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church affaires, will evidently appeare, if we conſult with the context, rather then with Commenters. For the Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſpent the former part of the Epiſtle, partly in the confirmation of his calling, partly in diſputation againſt juſtification by the works of the Law, to the end of <hi>v.</hi> 8. of Chap. 5. in the ninth Verſe he deſcendeth not to exhort unto <hi>bonos mores</hi> in generall, (as uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Commenters take it) but to inſtruct in Church Diſcipline, in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:196745:11"/>which he giveth three or foure directions to the tenth v. of Chap. 6.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Touching the cenſure of thoſe corrupt Teachers; who had perverted and troubled them with that corrupt Doctrine of juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by works. Chap. 5. ver. 9. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Touching the gentle admonition and reſtoring of a brother fallen by infirmitie, Chap. 6. ver. 1. to 5.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Touching the maintenance of their Miniſters, ver. 6, 7, 8. and beneficence to others, ver. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt, the cenſure of their corrupt teachers. 1 He layeth for the ground of it (that which himſelf gave for the ground of the excommunication of the inceſtuous Corinth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.) <hi>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</hi> verſ. 9. 2 He preſumeth the Church will be of the ſame mind with him, and concur in the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him that troubled them with corrupt doctrine, v. 10. (from fellowſhip with which corrupt doctrine he cleareth himſelf, v. 11.) 3 He proceedeth to declare, what cenſure he wiſheth might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed againſt him, and the reſt of thoſe corrupt teachers. <hi>I would</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they were even cut off that trouble you:</hi> cut off, to wit, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, ver. 12. Now leſt it ſhould be objected by the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Church: But what power have we to cut them off? The Apoſtle anſwereth, they have a power and libertie (to wit, to joyn with the ſounder part of the Presbyterie, in caſting them out, or cutting them off:) <hi>For brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you are called unto liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it ſhould be further objected, Yea, but give the people this power and libertie in ſome caſes, either to caſt off their teachers, or to cut them off, the people will ſoon take advantage to abuſe this libertie unto much carnall licentiouſneſſe. The Apoſtle preventeth that with a word of wholſome counſell: <hi>Brethren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you have been called unto libertie: onely uſe not your libertie as an occaſion to the fleſh, but by love ſerve one another,</hi> v. 13. and thereupon ſeaſonably pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueth this counſell with a caveat to beware of abuſing this liberty to carnall contention, (an uſuall diſeaſe of popular liberty) and withall dehorteth them from all other fruits of the fleſh, to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p>Evident therefore it is, that there is a key of power or libertie gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Church (to the Brethren with the Elders) as to open a doore of entrance to the Miniſters calling; ſo to ſhut the doore of entrance againſt them in ſome caſes, as when through corrupt and pernicious doctrine, they turn from Shepherds to become ravenous wolves.</p>

               <p>Having ſpoken then of that firſt key of order, namely, the key of <hi>power,</hi> (in a more large ſenſe) or liberty in <hi>the Church,</hi> there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the other <hi>key of order,</hi> which is the key of <hi>Authority</hi> or of <hi>Rule,</hi> in a more ſtrict ſenſe, which is in the <hi>Elders</hi> of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Authoritie is a morall power, in a ſuperiour order</hi> (or ſtate) <hi>binding or releaſing an inferious in point of ſubjection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This key when it was promiſed to <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 16.19. and given to him with the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.23. they thereby had power to bind and looſe: and it is the ſame Authority which is given to their ſucceſſours the Elders whereby they are called to feed and rule the Church of God, as the Apoſtles had done before them. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. And indeed by opening and applying the Law (the ſpirit of bondage accompanying the ſame) they bind ſinners under the curſe, and their conſciences under guilt of ſin, and fear of wrath, and ſhut the kingdom of heaven againſt them. And by opening and applying the Goſpel (the Spirit of Adoption accompanying the ſame) they remit ſin, and looſe the conſciences of beleeving repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſouls from guilt of ſin, and open to them the doores of heaven. By vertue of this key, as they preach <hi>with all authoritie,</hi> not onely the doctrine of the Law, but alſo the Covenant of the Goſpel; ſo they adminiſter the ſeals thereof, Baptiſme, and the Lords Supper. By virtue alſo of this key, they with the Church do bind an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate offender under excommunication, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17, 18. and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe, and forgive him upon his repentance. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.</p>
               <p>This Diſtribution of the <hi>keyes,</hi> and ſo of <hi>ſpirituall power,</hi> in the things of Chriſts kingdom we have received from the Scripture. But if any men out of love to Antiquitie, do rather affect to keep to the terms of the former more ancient Diſtribution (as there be who are as loath to change <hi>Antiquos terminos verborum,</hi> as <hi>agrorum</hi>) we would not ſtick upon the words rightly explained, out of deſire both to judge and ſpeak the ſame things with fellow-brethren. Onely then let them allow ſome ſpirituall power to the key of knowledge, though not Church-power. And in Church power let them put in as well a <hi>key of liberty,</hi> that is, a power and priviledge <hi>of intereſt,</hi> as a <hi>key of Authoritie.</hi> And by their key of order, as they do underſtand the key of office, ſo let them not divide from it the key of juriſdiction (for Chriſt hath given no juriſdiction, but to whom he hath given office) and ſo we willingly conſent with them.</p>

               <p>AS the keyes of the kingdom of heaven be divers, ſo are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to whom they are committed, divers: as in the naturall body, diverſitie of functions belongeth to diverſity of members.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>key of knowledge</hi> (or which is all one, the key of Faith) belongeth to all the faithfull, whether joyned to any particular Church or no. As in the primitive times, men of grown yeers were firſt called and converted to the faith, before they were received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church: And even now an Indian or Pagan may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the Church, till he have firſt received the faith, and have made profeſſion of it before the Lord, and the Church: which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the key of knowledge is given not onely to the Church, but to ſome before they enter into the Church. And yet to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans for the Churches ſake: that they who receive this grace of faith, by it may receive Chriſt and his benefits, and therewith may receive alſo this priviledge, to find an <hi>open doore</hi> ſet before them, to enter into the fellowſhip of the Church.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>key of order</hi> (ſpeaking as we do of Church order, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.5.) belongeth to all ſuch, who are in Church order, whether <hi>Elders</hi> or <hi>Brethren.</hi> For though Elders be in a ſuperiour order, by reaſon of their office, yet the brethren (over whom the Elders are made Overſeers and Rulers) they ſtand alſo in an order, even in orderly ſubjection, according to the order of the Goſpel. It is true, every faithful ſoul that hath received a key of knowledge, is bound to watch over his neighbours ſoul, as his own, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him of his ſin, unleſſe he be a ſcorner: but this he doth, <hi>Non ratione ordinis, ſed intuitu charitatis:</hi> not by vertue of a ſtate of order which he is in (till in Church fellowſhip) but as of common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian love and charitie. But every faithfull Chriſtian who ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Church order is bound to do the ſame, as well <hi>reſpectu or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinis,</hi> as <hi>intuitu charitatis,</hi> by virtue of that royall Law, not onely of love, but of Church order, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. whereby if his brother who offended him, do not hearken to his conviction and admonition, he is then according to order, to proceed further, taking one or two with him: and if the offender refuſe to hear them alſo, then he is by order to tell the Church, and afterwards walk towards him, as God ſhall direct the Church to order it.</p>

               <p>THis key is given to the Brethren of the Church: for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.13. (in the place quoted and opened before) <hi>Brethren, you have been called to liberty.</hi>
               </p>

The Goſpel alloweth no Church authority (or rule properly ſo called) to the Brethren, but reſerveth that wholly to the Elders; and yet preventeth the tyrannie and oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garchy, and exorbitancy of the Elders, by the large and firm eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the liberties of the Brethren, which ariſeth to a <hi>power</hi> in them. <hi>Bucers</hi> axiome is here notable; <hi>Poteſtaspenes omnem Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiameſt; Authoritas miniſterii penes Presbyteros &amp; Epiſcopos.</hi> In <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. where <hi>Poteſtas,</hi> or <hi>power</hi> being contradiſtinguiſhed from <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas, Authority</hi> is nothing elſe but a liberty or priviledge.</p>
               <p>The liberties of the Brethren, or of the Church conſiſting of them, are many and great.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Church of Brethren hath the <hi>power, priviledges</hi> and <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to chooſe their officers. In the choyce of an Apoſtle in to the place of <hi>Judas,</hi> the people went as far as humane vote and ſuffrage could go. Out of 120. perſons, (<hi>v.</hi> 15.) they choſe out, and preſented two; out of which two (becauſe an Apoſtle was to be deſigned immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by God) God by lot choſe one; And yet this one ſo choſen of God, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

And this place <hi>Cyprian</hi> preſſeth amongſt others, to confirm the <hi>power,</hi> (that is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>priviledge,</hi> or <hi>liberty</hi>) of the people in chooſing or refuſing their Miniſters. <hi>Plebs Chriſtiana</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>vel maxime poteſtatem habet, vel dignos ſacerdotes eligendi, ves indignos recuſandi,</hi> Epiſtol. 4. lib. 1.</p>
               <p>The like, or greater liberty is generally approved by the beſt of our Divines (ſtudious of Reformation) from <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:196745:13"/>They <hi>ordained them Elders, choſen by lifting up of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame <hi>power</hi> is cleerly expreſſed in the choyce of Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.3.5, 6. The Apoſtles did not chooſe the Deacons, but called the multitude together, and ſaid unto them, <hi>Brethren, looke you out ſeven men amongst you whom we may appoint over this buſineſſe: And the ſaying pleaſed the whole multitude, and they choſe</hi> Stephen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is a <hi>priviledge,</hi> or a <hi>liberty</hi> the Church hath received, to ſend forth one or more of their Elders, as the publike ſervice of Chriſt and of the Church may require. Thus <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> or <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of the Church of <hi>Philippi</hi> unto <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2.25.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Brethren</hi> of the Church have <hi>power</hi> and <hi>liberty</hi> of propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding any juſt exception againſt ſuch as offer themſelves to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto their communion, or unto the ſeales of it: Hence <hi>Saul,</hi> when hee offered himſelf to the communion of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not at firſt admitted thereto, upon an exception taken againſt him by the <hi>Diſciples</hi> till that exception was removed, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.26, 27. and <hi>Peter</hi> did not admit the family of <hi>Cornelius</hi> to Baptiſme, till he had inquired of the <hi>Brethren,</hi> if any of them had any exception againſt it, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.47.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As the <hi>Brethren</hi> have a <hi>power</hi> of order, and the <hi>priviledge</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with their <hi>Brethren,</hi> in caſe of private ſcandals, according to the rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16. So in caſe of publike ſcandall, the whole Church of <hi>Brethren</hi> have <hi>power</hi> and <hi>priviledge</hi> to joyn with the <hi>Elders,</hi> in inquiring, hearing, judging of publike ſcandals; ſo as to binde no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious offenders and impenitents under cenſure, and to forgive the repentant: For when Chriſt commandeth a brother, in caſe that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence cannot be healed privately, then to <hi>tell the Church, Mat.</hi> 18.17. it neceſſarily implyeth that the Church muſt heare him, and inquire into the offence complained of, and judge of the offence as they find it upon inquiry. When the Brethren that were of the circumciſion expoſtulated with <hi>Peter</hi> about his communion with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his uncircumciſed family, <hi>Peter</hi> did not reject them, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt him, as tranſgreſſing the bounds of their juſt <hi>power</hi> and <hi>priviledge,</hi> but readily addreſſed himſelf to give ſatisfaction to them all, <hi>Act.</hi> 1, 1, 2 to 18. The <hi>Brethren of the Church of Corinth</hi> being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together with their Elders, <hi>in the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>with his power, did deliver the inceſtuous perſon to Satan,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.4, 5. And <hi>Paul</hi> reproveth them all, Brethren as well as Elders, that they had no ſooner put him away from amongſt them, <hi>v.</hi> 2. and expreſly he alloweth to them all power <hi>to judge</hi> them that are within, <hi>v.</hi> 22.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:196745:14"/>Yea, and from thence argueth, in all the Saints, even in the meaneſt of the Saints, and ability to judge between brethren, in the things of this life, as thoſe that have received ſuch a ſpirit of diſcerning from Chriſt, by which they ſhall one day judge the world, even Angels, ſo in the next Chapter, the 6. of that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2, 3, 4, 5. And the ſame <hi>Brethren</hi> of the ſame Church, as well as the <hi>Elders,</hi> he intreateth <hi>to forgive</hi> the ſame inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> upon his repentance, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, to <hi>judge</hi> is an act of rule; and to be Rulers of the Church, is not given to all the Brethren, but to the Elders only: <hi>Anſw.</hi> All judgement is not an act of authority or rule, for there is a judgement of diſcretion, by way of <hi>priviledge,</hi> as well as of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority by way of ſentence: That of diſcretion is common to all the Brethren, as well as that of authority belongeth to the Presbytery of that Church. In <hi>England,</hi> the Jury by their verdict, as well as the Judge by his ſentence, do both of them judge the ſame male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor; yet in the Jury their verdict is but an act of their popular liberty: In the Judge it is an act of his judiciall authority.</p>
               <p>If it be demanded, What difference is there between theſe two?</p>
               <p>The anſwer is ready, Great is the difference: for though the Jury have given up their judgement and verdict, yet the malefactor is not thereupon legally condemned, much leſſe executed, but upon the ſentence of the Judge: In like ſort here, though the Brethren of the Church do with one accord give up their vote and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the cenſure of an offender, yet he is not thereby cenſured, till upon the ſentence of the Presbytery.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid again; Yea, but it is an act of authority to binde and looſe, and the power to bind and looſe, Chriſt gave to the whole Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The whole Church may be ſaid to bind and looſe, in that the Brethren conſent, and concurre with the Elders, both before the Cenſure in diſcerning it to be juſt and equall, and in declaring their diſcernment, by lifting up of their hands, or by ſilence: and after the cenſure, in rejecting the offender cenſured from their wonted Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. And yet their diſcerning or approving of the juſtice of the cenſure before-hand, is not a preventing of the Elders in their work. For the Elders before that have not onely privately examined the offender and his offence, and the proofes thereof, to prepare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ripen it for the Churches cognizance: but doe alſo publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reviſe the heads of all the materiall paſſages thereof before the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:196745:14"/>Church: and doe withall declare to the Church the counſell and will of God therein, that they may rightly diſcerne and approve what cenſure the Lord requireth to be adminiſtred in ſuch a caſe. So that the peoples diſcerning and approving the juſtice of the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure before it be adminiſtred, ariſeth from the Elders former inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and direction of them therein: Whereunto the people give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in obedience to the will and rule of Chriſt. Hence is that ſpeech of the Apoſtle; <hi>Wee have in readineſſe to revenge all diſobedience, when your OBEDIENCE IS F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LFILLED,</hi> 2 Cor. 10.6. The Apoſtles revenge of diſobedience by way of reproofe in preaching, doth not follow the peoples obedience, but proceedeth whether the people obey it or no. It was therefore their revenge of diſobedience by way of cenſure in diſcipline, which they had in readineſſe, when the obedience of the Church is fulfilled in diſcerning and approving the Equitie of the Cenſure, which the Apoſtles or Elders have declared to them from the Word.</p>
               <p>This power or priviledge of the Church in dealing in this ſort with a ſcandalous offender, may not be limited only to a private bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offending, but may reach alſo to an offenſive Elder. For (as hath been touched already) it is plaine that the Brethren of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, ſuppoſing <hi>Peter</hi> to have given an offence in eating with men uncircumciſed, they openly expoſtulated with him about his offence: and he ſtood not with them upon termes of his Apoſtleſhip, much leſſe of his Elderſhip, but willingly ſubmitted himſelfe to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to them all, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.2. to 18. And <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to the Church of <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> to deale with <hi>Archippus,</hi> warning him to ſee to the fulfilling of his Miniſtery, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.17. And very pregnant is his direction to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> for their proceeding to the utmoſt with their corrupt and ſcandalous falſe Teachers. <hi>I would</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they were even cut off that trouble you;</hi> And that upon this very ground of their <hi>libertie, Gal.</hi> 5.12, 13. as hath been opened above in Chap. 2.</p>
               <p>But whether the Church hath power or libertie for proceeding to the utmoſt cenſure of their whole Presbytery, is a Queſtion of more difficultie.</p>
               <p>For 1. It cannot well be conceived that the whole Presbytery ſhould be proceeded againſt, but that by reaſon of their ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into the hearts of many of the Brethren, a ſtrong partie of the Brethren will be ready to ſide with them: and in caſe of finding diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſion and oppoſition, the Church ought not to proceed without conſulting with the Synod. As when there aroſe diſſenſion in the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:196745:15"/>Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> and SIDING, (or as the word is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) they ſent up to the Apoſtles and Elders at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who in way of Synod de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the buſineſſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2. to 23. A precedent and patterne of due Church proceedings in caſe of diſſenſion, when ſome take with one ſide, ſome with another. But of that more here after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Excommunication</hi> is one of the <hi>higheſt</hi> acts of <hi>Rule</hi> in the Church, and therefore cannot be performed but by ſome Rulers. Now where all the Elders are culpable, there be no Rulers left in that Church to cenſure them. As therefore the Presbytery cannot excommunicate the whole Church, (though Apoſtate) for they muſt tell the Church, and joyne with the Church in that Cenſure: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the Church excommunicate the whole Presbytery, becauſe they have not received from Chriſt an office of rule, without their Officers.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, the <hi>twentie-foure Elders</hi> (who repreſent the private members of the Church, as the <hi>foure living Creatures</hi> doe the foure Officers) had all of them <hi>Crowns</hi> upon their heads, and <hi>ſate</hi> upon <hi>thrones</hi> (<hi>Rev.</hi> 4.4.) which are ſignes of regall authoritie: The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, The crowns and thrones argue them to be <hi>Kings,</hi> no more then their <hi>white rayments</hi> argue them to be <hi>Prieſts, ver.</hi> 4. but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prieſts nor Kings by office, but by libertie to performe like ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall duties by grace, which the other doe by grace and office: As Prieſts they offer up ſpirituall ſacrifices: and as Kings they rule their luſts, paſſions, themſelves, and their families, yea, the world and Church alſo after a ſort: the world, by improving it to ſpirituall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: and the Church, by appointing their own Officers, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in cenſuring their offenders, not onely by their officers, (which is as much as Kings are wont to doe) but alſo by their own royall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which Kings are not wont to doe, but onely in the execution of Nobles.</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſſe, though the Church want authoritie to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their Presbytery, yet they want not libertie to withdraw from them: For ſo <hi>Paul</hi> inſtructeth and beſeecheth the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (whom the holy Ghoſt foreſaw would moſt ſtand in need of this counſell) to make uſe of this libertie: <hi>I beſeech you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>mark ſuch as cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the DOCTRINE you have received,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>WITHDRAW from them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, by the agitation of this objection, there appeare two li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Church more to be added to the former.</p>
               <p>One is this (which is the fifth libertie in members) the Church
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:196745:15"/>hath libertie in caſe of diſſenſion amongſt themſelves to reſort to a Synod, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1, 2. Where alſo it appeareth the Brethren enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this libertie, to diſpute their doubts till they were ſatisfied, <hi>ver.</hi> 7.12. to joyne with the Apoſtles and Elders in the definitive ſentence, and in the promulgation of the ſame, <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23.</p>
               <p>The ſixt Libertie of the Church is, To withdraw from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of thoſe, whom they want authoritie to excommunicate. For as they ſet up the Presbytery, by profeſſing their ſubjection to them in the Lord: ſo they avoyd them by profeſſed withdrawing their ſubjection from them according to God.</p>
               <p>A ſeventh and laſt libertie of the Church, is, Libertie of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with other Churches. Communion we ſay: for it is a great Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, that no particular Church ſtandeth in ſubjection to another particular Church, no, not to a Cathedrall Church: but that all the Churches enjoy mutuall brotherly communion amongſt themſelves: which communion is mutually exerciſed amongſt them ſeven waies, which for brevitie and memory ſake, we ſumme up in ſeven words. 1. By way of Participation. 2. Of Recommendation. 3. Of Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4. Of Congregation into a Synod. 5. Of Contribution. 6. Of Admonition. 7. Of Propagation or Multiplication of Churches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of Participation, the members of one Church, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally comming to another Church, where the Lords Supper com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be adminiſtred, are willingly admitted to partake with them at the Lords Supper, in caſe that neither themſelves, nor the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches from whence they came, doe lie under any publique offence. For wee receive the Lords Supper, not onely as a Seale of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Lord Jeſus, and with his members in our owne Church, but alſo in all the Churches of the Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By way of Recommendation; Letters are ſent from one Church to another, recommending to their watchfulneſſe and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, any of their members, who by occaſion of buſineſſe, are for a time to reſide amongſt them. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſent Letters of Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the behalfe of <hi>Phoebe,</hi> a Deaconeſſe of the Church at <hi>Cenchrea,</hi> Rom. 16.1, 2. And of theſe kind of Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he ſpeaketh to the Church of <hi>Coriuth</hi> alſo, though not as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to himſelfe (who was well known to them) yet for others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.1.</p>
               <p>But if a member of one Church have juſt occaſion to remove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his family, to take up his ſetled habitation in another Church, then the Letters written by the Church in his behalfe, doe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:196745:16"/>recommend him to their perpetuall watchfulneſſe and communion. And if the other church have no juſt cauſe to refuſe him, they of his own church do by thoſe letters wholly diſmiſſe him from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; whereupon the letters (for diſtinction ſake) are called let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of diſmiſſion; which indeed do not differ from the other, but in the durance of the recommendation, the one recommending him for a time, the other for ever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By way of conſultation, one Church hath liberty of communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with another to require their judgement and counſell, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any perſons or cauſe, wherewith they may be better acquainted then themſelves. Thus the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> by their meſſengers conſulted with the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> touching the neceſſity of circumciſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.3. although the conſultation brought forth a further effect of communion with Churches; to wit, their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation into a Synod. Which is the fourth way of communion of Churches: All of the Churches have the like liberty of ſending their meſſengers to debate and determine in a Synod, ſuch matters as do concern them all; As the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> ſent meſſengers to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> for reſolution and ſatisfaction in a doubt that troubled them: the like liberty by proportion might any other Church have taken; yea, many Churches together; yea, all the Churches in the world, in any caſe that might concern them all. What authority theſe Synods have received, and may put forth, will come to be conſidered in the ſequele.</p>
               <p>A fifth way of communion of Churches is, the liberty of giving and receiving mutuall ſupplies and ſuccours one from another. The Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> communicated to the Churches of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> their ſpirituall treaſures of gifts of Grace; and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> miniſtred back again to them, liberall oblations of outward beneficence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.26, 27. <hi>Act.</hi> 11.29, 30. When the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> aboundeth with more variety of ſpirituall gifted men then the ſtate of their own Church ſtood in need of; they faſted and prayed; as for other ends, ſo for the inlargement of Chriſts Kingdome in the improvement of them. And the Holy Ghoſt opened them a dore for the ſuccour of many countries about them, by the ſending forth of ſome of them, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>A ſixth way of communion of Churches is by way of mutuall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, when a publike offence is found amongſt any of them: For as <hi>Paul</hi> had liberty to admoniſh <hi>Peter</hi> before the whole Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> when hee ſaw him walke not with a right foot (and yet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:196745:16"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had no authority over <hi>Peter,</hi> but onely both of them had equall mutuall intereſt one in another) <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.11. to 14. So by the ſame proportion, one Church hath liberty to admoniſh another, though they be both of them of equall authority; ſeeing one Church hath as much intereſt in another, as one Apoſtle in another. And if by the royall law of love, one Brother hath liberty to admoniſh his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame Church, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16.) then by the ſame rule of brotherly love and mutuall watchfulneſs one Church hath power to admoniſh another, in faithfulneſſe to the Lord, and unto them. The Church in the <hi>Canticles</hi> took care not only for her own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but for her little ſiſter, which ſhe thought had no breaſt; yea, and conſulteth with other churches what to do for her, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8. And would ſhe not then have taken like care, in caſe their little ſiſter having breaſts, her breaſts had been diſtempered, and given corrupt matter in ſtead of milke?</p>
               <p>A ſeventh way of communion of churches may be by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation and multiplication of churches: As when a particular Church of Chriſt ſhall grow ſo full of members, as all of them cannot heare the voyce of their Miniſters; then as an Hive full of Bees ſwarmeth forth, ſo is the church occaſioned to ſend forth a ſufficient number of her members, fit to enter into a church-ſtate, and to carrry along church-work amongſt themſelves. And for that end they either ſend forth ſome one or other of their Elders with them, or direct them where to procure ſuch to come unto them. The like courſe is wont to be taken, when ſundry Chriſtians com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over from one countrey to another; ſuch as are come over firſt, and are themſelves full of company, direct thoſe that come after them, and aſſiſt them in like ſort, in the combination of themſelves into Church order, according to the rule of the Goſpel. Though the Apoſtles be dead, whoſe office it was to plant &amp; gather and multiply Churches; yet the work is not dead, but the ſame power of the keyes is left with the Churches in common, and with each particular church for her part, according to their meaſure, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate and inlarge the kingdome of Chriſt (as God ſhall give op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity) throughout all generations.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the ſubject to whom the key of <hi>Authority</hi> is committed.</head>
               <p>THe key of <hi>Authoritie</hi> or <hi>Rule,</hi> is committed to the Elders of the Church, and ſo the act of Rule is made the proper act of their office. <hi>The Elders that rule well,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 5.17. Heb. 13.7.17.</p>
               <p>The ſpeciall acts of this rule are many.</p>
               <p>The firſt and principall is that which the <hi>Elders who labour in the Word and Doctrine,</hi> are chiefly to attend unto, that is, the <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word with all Authoritie,</hi> and that which is annexed thereto, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments or ſeals. <hi>Speak, rebuke and exhort</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi>) <hi>with all authoritie.</hi> Tit. 2.15. And that the adminiſtration of the ſeals is annexed thereto, is plain from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Go</hi> (ſaith Chriſt to the Apoſtles) <hi>make Diſciples, and baptize them, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be objected, private members may all of them prophecie pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 31. and therefore alſo baptize: and ſo this act of Authority is not peculiar to preaching Elders.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The place in the Corinths doth not ſpeak of ordinarie private members, but of men furniſhed with extraordinary gifts. Kings at the time of their firſt Coronation give many extraordinary large gifts, which they do not daily poure out in like ſort in their ordinary government. Chriſt ſoon after his aſcenfion poured out a larger meaſure of his ſpirit then in times ſucceeding. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of Corinth (as of many other in thoſe primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times) were <hi>inriched with all knowledge, and in all utterance.</hi> I <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.5. And the ſame perſons that had the <hi>gift of propheſie</hi> in the Church of Corinth, had alſo <hi>the gift of tongues,</hi> which put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Apoſtle a neceſſitie to take them off from their frequent ſpeaking with tongues, by preferring propheſie before it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.2. to 24. So that though all they might propheſie (as having extraordinary gifts for it) yet the like libertie is not allowed to them that want the like gifts. In the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> none beſides the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites,</hi> did ordinarily propheſie, either in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or in the Synagogues, unleſſe they were either furniſhed with extraordinatie gifts of propheſie, (as the Prophets of Iſrael) or were ſet apart, and trained up, to prepare for ſuch a calling, <hi>as the ſons of the Prophets.</hi> When <hi>Amos</hi> was forbidden by the <hi>high Prieſt</hi> of <hi>Bethel,</hi> to propheſie at <hi>Bethel, Amos</hi> doth not alledge nor plead
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:196745:17"/>the libertie of any Iſraelite to propheſie in the holy Aſſemblies, but alledgeth onely his extraordinarie calling, <hi>Amos</hi> 7.14, 15. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth alſo that the <hi>ſons of the Prophets,</hi> that is, men ſet apart, and trained up to prepare for that calling, were allowed the like libertie, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. But neither the ſons of the Prophets, nor the Prophets themſelves, were wont to offer ſacrifices in Iſrael, (except <hi>Samuel</hi> and <hi>Eliah</hi> by ſpeciall direction) nor did the extraordinarie Prophets in Corinth take upon them to adminiſter Sacraments.</p>
               <p>If any reply, That if the Prophets in the Church at Corinth had been endued with extraordinarie giſts of prophefie, they had not been <hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>judgement of the Prophets,</hi> which theſe are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> It followeth not. For the people of God were to examine all propheſies, <hi>by the Law</hi> and <hi>teſtimonie,</hi> and not to receive them but according to that rule. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.20. Yea, and <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all his Doctrine <hi>to the Law</hi> and <hi>Prophets. Act.</hi> 26.22. And the Bereans are commended for examining <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine according to the Scriptures. <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11, 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond act of Authoritie common to the Elders, is, they have power, as any weighty occaſion ſhall require, <hi>to call the Church</hi> together, as the <hi>Apoſtles called the Church together</hi> for the election of Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. And in like ſort are the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the old Teſtament ſtirred up to call a <hi>ſolemne Aſſembly,</hi> to gather the Elders, and all the inhabitants of the land, to <hi>ſanctifie a Faſt. Joel</hi> 1.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is an act of their power, to examine, if Apoſtles, then any others (whether officers or members) before they be received of the Church. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2.</p>
               <p>A fourth act of their rule is, the <hi>Ordination of officers</hi> (whom the people have choſen) whether Elders or Deacons. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Act.</hi> 6.6.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is an act of the <hi>key of Authoritie,</hi> that the Elders <hi>open the doores of ſpeech and ſilence</hi> in the Aſſembly. They were the <hi>Rulers of the Synagogue,</hi> who ſent to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to open their mouthes in a <hi>word of exhortation, Act.</hi> 13.15. and it is the ſame power which calleth men to ſpeak, to put men to ſilence when they ſpeak amiſſe. And yet when the <hi>Elders</hi> themſelves do lie under of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or under ſuſpition of it, the Brethren have liberty to require ſatisfaction, in a modeſt manner, concerning any publick breach of rule, as hath been mentioned above out of <hi>Act.</hi> 11.2, 3, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:196745:18"/>
               <p n="6">6. It belongeth to the <hi>Elders</hi> to <hi>prepare matters beforehand,</hi> which are to be tranſacted by themſelves, or others in the face of the Congregation, as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> being met at the houſe of <hi>Iames,</hi> gave direction to <hi>Paul,</hi> how to carry himſelf, that he might prevent the offence of the Church, when he ſhould appear before them. <hi>Act.</hi> 21.18. Hence when the offence of a brother is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rule in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17.) to be brought to the <hi>Church,</hi> they are beforehand to conſider and enquire whether the offence be really given or no, whether duely proved, and orderly proceeded in by the Brethren, according to rule, and not duly ſatisfied by the offender: leſt themſelves and the Church, be openly cumbred with unneceſſary and tedious agitations: but that all things tranſacted before the Church, be carried along with moſt expedition and beſt edification. In which reſpect they have power to reject cauſleſſe and diſorderly complaints, as well as to propound and handle juſt complaints before the Congregation.</p>
               <p n="7">7. In the handling of an offence before the Church, the Elders have authoritie both <hi>Jus dicere,</hi> and <hi>Sententiam ſerre;</hi> When the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence appeareth truly ſcandalous; the Elders have power from God to informe the Church, what the <hi>Law</hi> (or <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>will</hi>) of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is for the cenſure of ſuch an offence: And when the Church diſcerns the ſame, and hath no juſt exception againſt it, but condeſcendeth thereto, it is a further act of the Elders power, to <hi>give ſentence</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the offender. Both theſe acts of power in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, are foretold by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> Chap. 44.23, 24. <hi>They ſhall teach my people the difference between holy and prophane, and cauſe them to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne between the uncleane and the cleane.</hi> And in <hi>controverſie they ſhall ſtand in judgement,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall judge it according to my judgement, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. The Elders have power <hi>to diſmiſſe the Church,</hi> with <hi>a bleſſing</hi> in the name of the Lord, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.23. to 26. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.7.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The <hi>Elders</hi> have received power, to <hi>charge</hi> any of the people in <hi>private,</hi> that none of them live either <hi>inordinately</hi> without a calling, or <hi>idlely</hi> in their calling, or <hi>ſcandalouſly</hi> in any ſort, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. &amp; <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 10, 11, 12. The Apoſtles command argueth a power in the Elders, to charge theſe duties upon the people effectually.</p>
               <p n="10">10. What power belongeth to the Elders in a <hi>Synod;</hi> is more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſpoken to in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Synods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11. In caſe the Church ſhould fall away to blaſphemy againſt Chriſt, and obſtinate rejection and perſecution of the way of grace, and either no Synod to be hoped for, or no helpe by a Synod, the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:196745:18"/>have power to <hi>withdraw</hi> (or <hi>ſeparate</hi>) the <hi>Diſciples</hi> from them, and to carry away the Ordinances with them, and therewithall ſadly to denounce the juſt judgement of God againſt them, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.9 <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.7. <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> But if Elders have all this power to exerciſe all theſe acts of Rule, partly over the private members, partly over the whole Church, how are they then called the <hi>ſervants of the Church?</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Elders to be both ſervants and Rulers of the Church, may both of them ſtand well together. For their rule is not lordly, as if they ruled of themſelves, or for themſelves, but ſtewardly and miniſteriall, as ruling the Church from Chriſt, and alſo from their call: and withall, ruling the Church for Chriſt; and for the Church, even for their ſpirituall everlaſting good. A Queene may call her ſervants, her mariners, to pilot and conduct her over the Sea to ſuch an Haven: yet they being called by her to ſuch an office, ſhee muſt not rule them in ſteering their courſe, but muſt ſubmit her ſelfe to be ruled by them, till they have brought her to her deſired Haven. So is the caſe between the Church and her Elders.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Power and <hi>Authoritie</hi> given to <hi>Synods.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi>SYnods</hi> wee acknowledge, being rightly ordered, as an Ordinance of Chriſt. Of their Aſſembly wee find three juſt cauſes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 1. When a Church wanting light or peace at home, deſireth the counſell and helpe of other Churches, few or moe. Thus the <hi>Church of Antioch</hi> being annoyed with corrupt teachers, who dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the light of the truth, and bred no ſmall diſſenſion amongſt them in the Church; they ſent <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and other <hi>meſſengers</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> at Hieruſalem, for the eſtabliſhment of Truth and Peace. In joyning the Elders to the Apoſtles (and that doubtleſſe by the adviſe of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi>) it argueth that they ſent not to the Apoſtles as extraordinary and infallible, and authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Oracles of God, (for then what need the adviſe and helpe of Elders?) but as wiſe and holy guides of the Church, who might not onely relieve them by ſome wiſe counſell, and holy order, but alſo ſet a Precedent to ſucceeding ages, how errours and diſſenſions in Churches might be removed and healed. And the courſe which the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:196745:19"/>Apoſtles and Elders tooke for clearing the matter, was not by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the counſell of God with Apoſtolick authoritie, from imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate revelation, but by ſearching out the truth in an ordinary way of free diſputation, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 7. which is as fit a courſe for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in after ages, as it was ſeaſonable for practice then.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Juſt conſequence from Scripture giveth us another ground for the aſſembly of many churches, or of their meſſengers, into a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, when any church lyeth under ſcandall, through corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in doctrine and practice, and will not be healed by more private advertiſements of their own members, or of their neighbour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or Brethren. For there is a brotherly communion, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the members of the ſame church, ſo between the churches. <hi>We have a little ſiſter</hi> (ſaith one church to another, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8.) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore churches have a brotherly communion amongſt themſelves. Look then as one brother being offended with another, and not able to heal him by the mouth of two or three brethren private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it behooveth him to carry it to the whole church; ſo by propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if one church ſee matter of offence in another, and be not able to heal it in a more private way, it will hehove them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Aſſembly of many churches, that the offence may be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard, and judged and removed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It may ſo fall out, that the ſtate of all the churches in the countrey may be corrupted; and beginning to diſcern their corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may deſire the concurſe and counſell of one another, for a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſafe, and generall reformation. And then ſo meeting and conferring together, may renew their covenant with God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude and determine upon a courſe, that may tend to the publike healing, and ſalvation of them all. This was a frequent practice in the old Teſtament, in the time of <hi>Aſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 15.10. to 15. in the time of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.4. to 19. In the time of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.29. to 33. and in the time of <hi>Ezra,</hi> Ezra 10.1. to 5. Theſe and the like examples were not peculiar to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> as one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire <hi>nationall church:</hi> For in that reſpect they appealed from every <hi>Synagogue</hi> and Court in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to the <hi>nationall high Prieſt,</hi> and Court at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as being all of them ſubordinate thereunto (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that precedent is uſually waved by our beſt Divines, as not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliable to Chriſtian churches:) but theſe examples hold forth no ſuperiority in one church or court over another, but all of them in an equall manner, give advice in common, and take one common courſe for redreſſe of all. And therefore ſuch examples are fit precedents
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:196745:19"/>for churches of equall power within themſelves, to aſſemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and take order with one accord, for the reformation of them all.</p>
               <p>Now a <hi>Synod</hi> being aſſembled; three queſtions ariſe about their power: 1. <hi>What</hi> is that <hi>power</hi> they have received? 2. How far the <hi>fraternity concurreth</hi> with the Presbyterie in it; the brotherhood with the Elderſhip? 3. Whether the power they have recieved reacheth to the injoyning of things, both in their nature, and in their uſe indifferent?</p>
               <p>For the firſt; we dare not ſay that their power reacheth no farther then giving counſell: for ſuch as their ends be, for which according to God, they do aſſemble, ſuch is the power given them of God, as may attain thoſe ends. As they meet to miniſter light and peace to ſuch churches, as through want of light and peace lye in error (or doubt at leaſt) and variance; ſo they have power by the grace of Chriſt, not only to give light and counſell in matter of Truth and Practice; but alſo to command and enjoyn the things to be believed and done. The expreſſe words of the Synodall letter imply no leſſe; <hi>It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt, and unto us, to lay upon you no other burthen,</hi> Act. 15.27. This burthen therefore, to obſerve thoſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things which they ſpeak of, they had power to impoſe. It is an act of the binding power of the keys, to <hi>bind burthens.</hi> And this <hi>binding power</hi> ariſeth not only <hi>materially</hi> from the weight of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters impoſed, (which are neceſſary <hi>neceſſitate praecepti</hi> from the word) but alſo <hi>formally,</hi> from the authority of the Synod, which being an Ordinance of Chriſt, bindeth the more for the Synods ſake. As a truth of the Goſpel taught by a Miniſter of the Goſpel, it bindeth to faith an obedience, not only becauſe it is Goſpel, but alſo becauſe it is taught by a Miniſter for his callings ſake, ſeeing Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Who ſo receiveth you receiveth me.</hi> And ſeeing alſo a Synod ſometime meeteth to convince, and <hi>admoniſh</hi> an offending church or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie; they have <hi>power</hi> therefore, (if they cannot heal the offenders) to <hi>determine to withdraw communion from them.</hi> And further, ſeeing they meet likewiſe ſometimes for generall reformation; they have power to <hi>decree</hi> and publiſh ſuch <hi>Ordinances,</hi> as may conduce ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God, unto ſuch reformation: Examples whereof wee read, <hi>Neh.</hi> 10.32. to 39. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.12, 13.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond queſtion; How far the <hi>Fraternity,</hi> or the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the church, may <hi>concurre</hi> with the <hi>Elders</hi> in exerciſing the power of the Synod?</p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:196745:20"/>
               <p>The Anſwer is; The power which they have received, is a power of liberty: As 1. They have liberty to <hi>diſpute their doubts</hi> modeſtly and Chriſtanly amongſt the <hi>Elders:</hi> For in that Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as there was <hi>much diſputation, Act.</hi> 15.7. ſo the <hi>multitude</hi> had a part in the <hi>Diſputation,</hi> v. 12. For after <hi>Peters</hi> ſpeech, it is ſaid, <hi>the whole multitude kept ſilence,</hi> and ſilence from what? to wit, from the ſpeech laſt in hand amongſt them, and that was, from <hi>Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> 2. The <hi>Brethren</hi> of the church had liberty to joyn with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> in approving of the <hi>ſentence</hi> of <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining</hi> the ſame as the common ſentence of them all. 3. They had liberty to joyn with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> in <hi>chooſing</hi> and <hi>ſending meſſengers,</hi> and in <hi>writing Synodall</hi> Letters in the names of all, for the publiſhing of the ſentence of the Synod. Both theſe points are expreſſed in the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 22.23. to 29. Then pleaſed <hi>it the Apoſtles and Elders, with the whole Church, to ſend choſen men, and to write Letters by them.</hi> See the whole church diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders;</hi> and thoſe whom he called the <hi>whole Church,</hi> v. 22. he calleth <hi>the Brethren,</hi> v. 23. <hi>The Apoſtles, and Elders, and Brethren,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But though it may not be denyed, that the Brethren of the church preſent in the Synod, had all this power of liberty, to joyn with the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> in all theſe acts of the Synod; yet the <hi>authority of the Decrees</hi> lay chiefly (if not only) in the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> And therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.4. <hi>That</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas <hi>delivered to the Churches for to keep the Decrees that were ordained of the Apoſtles and Elders:</hi> So then it will be moſt ſafe to preſerve to the Church of <hi>Brethren</hi> their due liberties, and to reſerve to the <hi>Elders</hi> their due authority.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, The <hi>Elders</hi> aſſembled in a Synod, have no authority to determine or conclude any act that ſhall binde the Churches, but according to the inſtructions which before they have received from the Churches.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Wee do not ſo apprehend it; For what need Churches ſend to a Synod for light and direction in ways of truth and peace, if they be reſolved afore-hand how far they will go? It is true, if the <hi>Elders</hi> of Churches ſhall conclude in a Synod any thing preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiciall to the truth and peace of the Goſpel, they may juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulate with them at their return, and refuſe ſuch ſanctions as the Lord hath not ſancited. But if the <hi>Elders</hi> be gathered in the name of Chriſt in a Synod, and proceed according to the rule (the word)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:196745:20"/>or Chriſt, they may conſider and conclude ſundry points expedient for the eſtate of their Churches, which the Churches were either ignorant or doubtfull of before.</p>
               <p>As for the third Queſtion, whether the Synod have power to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn ſuch things as are both in their nature and their uſe indifferent? We ſhould anſwer it negatively, and our reaſons be:</p>
               <p>1. From the pattern of that precedent of Synods, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28. They laid upon the Churches no <hi>other burthen,</hi> but thoſe <hi>neceſſary things:</hi> neceſſary, though not all of them in their own nature, yet for preſent uſe, to <hi>avoid the offence</hi> both of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile:</hi> of the <hi>Jew,</hi> by <hi>eating things ſtrangled and blood;</hi> of the <hi>Gentile</hi> and <hi>Jew</hi> both, by <hi>eating things ſacrificed to Idols,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> expoundeth that <hi>Article</hi> of the Synod, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.10, 11, 12. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.28. This ea ing with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was a murther of a weak brothers ſoule, and a ſin againſt Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.11, 12. and therefore <hi>neceſſary</hi> to be forborn, <hi>neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ate praecepti,</hi> by the neceſſity of Gods Commandement.</p>
               <p>2. A ſecond reaſon may be from the latitude of the Apoſtolicall commiſſion, which was given to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. where the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtles are commanded to <hi>teach the people to obſerve all things which Chriſt had commanded.</hi> If then the Apoſtles teach the people to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve more then Chriſt hath commanded, they go beyond the bounds of their commiſſion, and a larger commiſſion then that given to the Apoſtles, nor Elders, nor Synods, nor churches can challenge.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, Chriſt ſpeaketh only of teaching ſuch things which he had commanded, as neceſſary to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the Apoſtles or their ſucceſſors ſhould hereupon uſurpe an authority to teach the people things indifferent, they muſt plead this their authority from ſome other commiſſion given them elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: for in this place there is no foot ſtep for any ſuch power. That much urged and much abuſed place in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. will not reach it. For though <hi>Paul</hi> requiring in that place, all the duties of Gods worſhip, whether Prayer or Propheſying, or Pſalmes, or Tongues, &amp;c. that they ſhould be performed <hi>decently and orderly,</hi> he thereby forbiddeth any performance thereof undecently; as for men with long hayre, and women to ſpeak in open aſſemblies, eſpecially to pray with their hair looſe about them. And though he forbiddeth alſo men <hi>ſpeaking two or three at once,</hi> which to do, were not <hi>order,</hi> but <hi>confuſion;</hi> yet he doth not at all, neither himſelf injoyn, nor allow the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to injoyn ſuch things as decent, whoſe want, or whoſe contrary is not undecent; nor ſuch orders, whoſe want or
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:196745:21"/>contrary would be no diſorder. Suppoſe the Church of Corinth, (or any other Church or Synod) ſhould enjoyn their Miniſters to preach in a gown. A gown is a decent garment to preach in: yet ſuch an Injunction is not grounded upon that Text of the Apoſtle. For then a Miniſter in neglecting to preach in a gown ſhould neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the commandment of the Apoſtle, which yet indeed he doth not. For if he preach in a cloak, he preacheth decently enough, and that is all which the Apoſtles Canon reacheth to. In theſe things Chriſt never provided for <hi>uniformitie,</hi> but onely for <hi>unity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For a third reaſon of this point, (and to adde no more) it is taken from the nature of the miniſteriall office, whether in a Church or Synod. Their office is <hi>ſtewardly,</hi> not <hi>lordly:</hi> they are Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours from Chriſt, and for Chriſt. Of a <hi>Steward</hi> it is required he be found <hi>faithfull,</hi> 1 Cor. 4.1, 2. and therefore he may diſpenſe no more injunctions to Gods houſe, then Chriſt hath appointed him: Neither may an Embaſſadour proceed to do any act of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, further then what he hath received in his Commiſſion from his Prince. If he go further, he maketh himſelf a Praevaricator, not an Embaſſadour.</p>
               <p>But if it be enquired, <hi>Whether a Synod hath power of Ordination and Excommunication;</hi> we would not take upon us haſtily to cenſure the many notable precedents of ancient and later Synods, who have put forth acts of power in both theſe kinds. Onely we doubt that <hi>from the beginning it was not ſo:</hi> and for our own parts, if any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of uſing this power ſhould ariſe amongſt our ſelves (which hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto through preventing mercie it hath not) we (in a Synod) ſhould rather chuſe to <hi>determine,</hi> and to <hi>publiſh</hi> and <hi>declare</hi> our deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. That the ordination of ſuch as we find fit for it, and the excommunication of ſuch as we find do deſerve it, would be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſervice both to the Lord, and to his Churches: but the <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of both theſe acts we ſhould refer to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of the <hi>ſeverall Churches,</hi> whereto the perſon to be ordained is called, and whereof the perſon to be excommunicate is a member: and both acts to be performed in the preſence, and with the conſent of the ſeverall Churches, to whom the matter appertaineth. For in the beginning of the Goſpel in that precedent of Synods, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. we find the falſe teachers <hi>declared</hi> to be <hi>diſturbers</hi> and <hi>troublers</hi> of the Churches, and <hi>ſubverters of their ſouls,</hi> Act. 15.24. but no condigne cenſure diſpenſed againſt them by the Synod. An evident argument to us, that they left the cenſure of ſuch offenders (in caſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:196745:21"/>not) to the particular Churches, to whom they did apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. And for Synodicall ordination, although <hi>Act.</hi> 1. be alledged, where <hi>Matthias</hi> was called to be an Apoſtle, yet it doth not appear that they acted then in a Synodicall way: no more then the <hi>Church of Antioch</hi> did, when with <hi>faſting and prayer</hi> they by their Presbyters <hi>impoſed hands</hi> on <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and thereby <hi>ſeparated</hi> them to <hi>the work</hi> of the Apoſtleſhip, whereto the holy <hi>Ghoſt had called them,</hi> Act. 13.1, 2, 3. Whence as the holy Ghoſt then ſaid, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </head>
               <p>WHat that Church is, which is the firſt Subject of the power of the keyes, and whether this Church have an independent power in the exerciſe thereof, though they be made two diſtinct Queſtions, yet (if candidely interpreted) they are but one. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is the firſt Subject of any accident or adjunct, the ſame is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent in the enjoyment of it, that is, in reſpect of deriving it from any other ſubject like it ſelf. As if fire be the firſt ſubject of heat, then it dependeth upon no other ſubject for heat. Now in the firſt ſubject of any power, three things concur. 1. It firſt receiveth that power whereof it is the firſt ſubject, and that reciprocally. 2. It firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and putteth forth the exerciſe of that power. 3. It firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth that power to others. As we ſee in Fire, which is the firſt ſubject of heat: it firſt receiveth heat, and that reciprocally. All fire is hot, and whatſoever is hot is fire, or hath fire in it. Again, Fire firſt putteth forth heat it ſelf, and alſo firſt communicateth heat, to whatſoever things elſe are hot. To come then to the firſt ſubiect of Church-power, or of the power of the keyes. The ſubſtance of the doctrine thereof, may be conceived and declared in a few Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Church-power is either ſupream and <hi>ſoveraign,</hi> or ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and <hi>miniſteriall.</hi> Touching the former, take this propoſition.</p>
               <p>The Lord Jeſus <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>head</hi> of his Church, is the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the firſt proper ſubiect of the <hi>ſoveraigne power</hi> of the keyes. <hi>He hath the key of David: He openeth, and no man ſhutteth; He ſhutteth, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:196745:22"/>no man openeth,</hi> Revel. 3.7. <hi>The government is upon his ſhoulder,</hi> Iſa. 9.6. And himſelf declareth the ſame to his Apoſtles, as the ground of his granting to them Apoſtolicall power. <hi>All power</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to me in heaven and earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. <hi>Go ye therefore, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence 1. <hi>All legiſlative power</hi> (power of making of Laws) in the Church is in him, and not from him derived to any other. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. The power derived to others, is onely to publiſh and execute his Laws and Ordinances, and to ſee them obſerved. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. His <hi>Laws are perfect,</hi> Pſal. 19.9. and do <hi>make the man of God perfect</hi> to every <hi>good work.</hi> 2 Tim. 3.17. and need no addition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From his ſoveraign power it proceedeth, that he onely can erect and ordain a true conſtitution of a Church-eſtate, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3.3. to 6. <hi>He buildeth his own houſe,</hi> and ſetteth the pattern of it, as God gave to <hi>David</hi> the pattern of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.19. None hath power to erect any other Church-frame, then as this Maſter-builder hath left us a pattern thereof in the Goſpel. In the old Teſtament the <hi>Church</hi> ſet up by him was <hi>Nationall,</hi> in the New, <hi>Congregationall;</hi> yet ſo as that in ſundrie caſes it is ordered by him, many congregations or their meſſengers, may be aſſembled into a Synod. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is from the ſame ſoveraigne power, that all the offices, or miniſteries in the Church are ordained by him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.5. yea and all the <hi>members are ſet in the body by him,</hi> together with all the power belonging to their offices and places: as in the naturall body, ſo in the Church. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.18.</p>
               <p n="4">4. From this ſoveraigne power in like ſort it is, that all gifts to diſcharge any office, by the officers, or any duty by the members, are from him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.11. All <hi>treaſures of wiſdome,</hi> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and grace, and the fulneſſe thereof are in him for that end, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.3. and v. 9, 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.16.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From this ſoveraigne power it is, that all the ſpirituall power, and efficacie, and bleſſing, in the adminiſtration of theſe gifts in theſe offices and places, for the gathering, and edifying, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of all the Churches, and of all the Saints in them is from him. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. <hi>Lo I am with you alwayes,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 1.29. 1 Cor. 15.9.</p>
               <p>The g od pleaſure of the Father, the perſonall union of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature with the eternall Son of God, His purchaſe of his Church with his own blood, and His deep humiliation of himſelf unto the death of the Croſſe, have all of them obtained to him this his higheſt exaltation, to be <hi>head over all things unto the Church,</hi> and to

               <p>But of this ſoveraigne power of Chriſt, there is no queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Proteſtants, eſpecially ſtudious of Reformation. Now as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Miniſteriall</hi> power, we give theſe following <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> A <hi>particular Church or Congregation of Saints, profeſſing the faith, TAKEN INDEFINITELY FOR ANY CHVRCH</hi> (one as well as another) <hi>is the firſt ſubject of all the Church-offices, with all their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall gifts and power,</hi> which Chriſt hath given to be executed amongſt them; <hi>whether it be</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollos, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>all are yours,</hi> (ſpeaking to the Church of <hi>Gorinth,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.22.) not as a peculiar priviledge unto them, but common to them with any other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular church. And theirs was ſuch a Church, of whom it is ſaid; <hi>That they came all together into one place,</hi> for the communication of their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall gifts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 23. And <hi>Paul</hi> telleth the ſame church, that <hi>God hath ſet the officers,</hi> and their gifts, and all variety of members, and their functions <hi>in his Church,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.28. where it is not ſo well tranſlated [<hi>Some</hi>] God hath <hi>ſet ſome</hi> in his church, for hee hath ſet all; but ſpeaking of the members of the church <hi>v.</hi> 27. he proceedeth to exemplifie thoſe members in <hi>v.</hi> 28. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>and which God hath ſet in his Church;</hi> that is, which members, <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, &amp;c.</hi> For though the Relative be not of the ſame gender with the Antecedent before, yet it is an uſuall thing with the pen-men of the new Teſtament, to reſpect the ſenſe of the words, and ſo the perſon intended, rather then the gender of their name, and to render the Relative of the ſame gender and caſe with the Subſtantive following: ſo here, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap>, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the new Teſtament, it is not a new obſervation that we never read of any nationall church, nor of any nationall officers given to them by Chriſt. In the old Teſtament indeed, we reade of a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall church. All the tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were three times in a yeer to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before the Lord in <hi>Jeruſalem, Deut.</hi> 16.16. And he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them there an high Prieſt of the whole nation, and certain ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne ſacrifices by him to be adminiſtred, <hi>Lev.</hi> 16.1. to 29. and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him other Prieſts and Elders, and Judges, to whom all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals ſhould be brought, and who ſhould judge all difficult and tranſcendent caſes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.8. to 11. but wee reade of no ſuch nationall church or high Prieſt, or court in the new Teſtament; And yet we willingly grant that particular churches of equall power,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:196745:23"/>may in ſome caſes appointed by Chriſt, meet together by themſelves, or by their meſſengers in a Synod, and may perform ſundry acts of power there, as hath been ſhewed above. But the officers themſelves, and all the Brethren members of the Synod; yea, and the Synods themſelves, and all the power they put forth, they are all of them <hi>primarily</hi> given to the ſeverall churches of particular Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, either as the firſt ſubject in whom they are reſident, or as the firſt object about whom they are converſant, and for whoſe ſake they are gathered and imployed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>Propoſ. The Apoſtles of Chriſt were the firſt ſubject of Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall power;</hi> Apoſtolicall power ſtood chiefly in two things: Firſt, in that each Apoſtle had in him all miniſteriall power of all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Church. They by vertue of their office might <hi>exhort as Paſtors,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1. <hi>teach as Teachers,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.7. <hi>rule as Rulers.</hi> 2 Tim. 4.1. <hi>receive</hi> and <hi>diſtribute</hi> the oblations of the Church as <hi>Deacons,</hi> Act. 4.35. yea, any one Apoſtle or Euangeliſt carried about with him the liberty and power of the whole Church; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might <hi>Baptize;</hi> yea, and cenſure an offender too, as if he had the preſence and concurrence of the whole Church with him. For we reade that <hi>Philip</hi> baptized the Eunuch without the preſence of any Church, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.38. And that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf excommunicated <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. and it is not mentioned that hee took the conſent of any Church or Presbyterie in it. It is true indeed, where he could have the conſent and concurſe of the Church and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in exerciſe of any act of church-power, he willingly took it, and joyned with it, as in the ordination of <hi>Timothy</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. with 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14.) and in the excommunication of the inceſtuous <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4, 5. But when both himſelf and the perſon to be baptized, or ordained, or excommunicated, were abſent and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from all churches, the Apoſtles might proceed to put forth their power in the adminiſtration of any church act without them. The amplitude and plenitude of power, which they received im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Chriſt, would beare them out in it. <hi>As my Father ſent me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) to wit, with amplitude and plenitude of ſoveraigne power, <hi>ſo ſend I you</hi> (with like amplitude and plenitude of miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall power) <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.21.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Apoſtolicall power extended it ſelf to all churches, as much as to any one. <hi>Their line went out into all the world,</hi> (Pſal. 19.4. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.) And as they received commiſſion to preach and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:196745:23"/>baptize in all the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. So they received charge to <hi>feed</hi> the flock of Chriſts <hi>Sheep and Lambs</hi> (which implyeth all acts of Paſtorall government over all the <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Lambs</hi> of Chriſt) <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.15, 16, 17. Now this Apoſtolicall power, centring all church-power into one man, and extending it ſelf forth to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of all churches, as the Apoſtles were the firſt ſubject of it, ſo were they alſo the laſt; Nevertheleſſe that ample and univerſall latitude of power, which was conjoyned in them, is now divided even by themſelves amongſt all the churches, and all the officers of the churches reſpectively, the officers of each church attending the charge of the particular church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to them, by vertue of their office, and yet none of them neglecting the good of other churches, ſo far as they may be mutually helpfull to one another in the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>Propoſ.</hi> When the church of a particular congregation walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth together in the truth and peace, the <hi>Brethren</hi> of the church are the <hi>firſt ſubject of church-liberty,</hi> and the <hi>Elders</hi> thereof of <hi>church-autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> and <hi>both</hi> of them together are the firſt ſubject of <hi>all church-power</hi> needfull to be exerciſed within themſelves, whether in the election and ordination of officers, or in the cenſure of offenders in their own body.</p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Propoſition</hi> there be three <hi>Branches:</hi> 1. That the Brethren of a particular church of a Congregation, are the firſt ſubjects of church-liberty: 2. That the Elders of a particular church, are the firſt ſubjects of church-authority: 3. That both the Elders and Brethren, walking and joyning together in truth and peace, are the firſt ſubjects of all church-power, needfull to be exerciſed in their own body.</p>
               <p>Now that the key of church-priviledge or liberty is given to the Brethren of the church, and the key of rule and authority to the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the church, hath been declared above, in <hi>Chapt.</hi> 3. But that theſe are the firſt ſubjects of theſe keys; and firſt the church, the firſt ſubject of liberty, may appeare thus.</p>
               <p>From the removall of any former ſubject of this power or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, from whence they might derive it. If the Brethren of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation were not the firſt ſubject of their church-liberty, then they derived it either from their own Elders, or from other churches. But they derived it not from their own Elders: for they had power and liberty to chooſe their own Elders, as hath been ſhewed above, and therefore they had this liberty before
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:196745:24"/>they had Elders, and ſo could not derive it from them.</p>
               <p>Nor did they derive it from other particular churches. For all particular churches are of equall liberty and power within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, not one of them ſubordinate to another. Wee reade not in Scripture, that the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> was ſubject to that of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> nor that of <hi>Epheſus</hi> to <hi>Corinth;</hi> no, nor that of <hi>Cenchrea</hi> to <hi>Corinth,</hi> though it was a church ſituate in their vicinity.</p>
               <p>Nor did they derive their liberty from a Synod of churches. For we found no foot-ſtep in the pattern of Synods, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. that the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> borrowed any of their liberties from the Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> They borrowed indeed light from them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, tending to the eſtabliſhment of truth and peace. For upon the publiſhing of the decrees of that Synod, the Churches were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the faith (or truth) <hi>Act</hi> 16.4, 5. and alſo in conſolation and peace, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.31, 32. but they did not borrow from them any church-liberty at all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now, the <hi>ſecond branch</hi> of the <hi>Propoſition</hi> was, That the Elders of the church of a particular Congregation, are the firſt ſubject of rule or authority, in that church (or congregation) over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made them over-ſeers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the charge of rule over the Church committed to them immediatly from Chriſt: For though the Elders be choſen to their office by the church of Brethren, yet the office it ſelf is ordained immediatly by Chriſt, and the rule annexed to the office, is limited by Chriſt only. If the Brethren of the church ſhould elect a presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie to be called by them in the Lord, this will not excuſe the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in their neglect of rule, either before the Lord, or to their own conſciences. For thus runneth the Apoſtles charge to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> (Act. 20.28.) <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, and to the whole flock, over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you over-ſeers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame appeareth from the gift of rule, required eſpecially in an Elder, without which they are not capable of election to that office in the church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 4, 5. He muſt be one <hi>that is able to rule well his own houſe,</hi> or elſe how ſhall he order the church of God? The like gift of rule is not neceſſary to the admiſſion of a member into the church, as to the election of an Elder: If a private brother be not ſo well able (through weakneſſe in prudence or courage) to rule his own houſe, it will not juſtly debarre him from entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church; but the like defect will juſtly debar a man from ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the office of an Elder. Neither hath God given a ſpirit of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:196745:24"/>rule and government ordinarily to the greater part of the body of the brethren: and therefore neither hath he given them the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the key of Authoritie, to whom he hath not given the gift to employ it.</p>
               <p>If it be objected; How can the brethren of the Church inveſt an Elder with rule over them, if they had not power of rule in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to communicate to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They inveſt him with rule, partly by chuſing him to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which God hath inveſted with rule, partly by profeſſing their own ſubjection to him in the Lord: we by the rule of Relatives doth neceſſarily inferre, and preferre the authoritie of the Elders over them. For in yeelding ſubjection, they either ſet up, or acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Authoritie in him, to whom they yeeld ſubjection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 2. The body of the Church is the Spouſe of Chriſt, the Lambs wife, and ought not the wife to rule the ſervants and ſtewards in the houſe, rather then they her? Is it not meet that the keyes of Authoritie ſhould hang at her girdle rather then at theirs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is a difference to be put between Queens, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, Ladies of great Honor, (ſuch as the Church is to Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.9.) and Countrey huſwives, poore mens wives. Queens and great perſons have ſeverall offices and officers for every buſineſſe and ſervice about the houſe, as Chamberlains, Stewards, Treaſurers, Comptrollers, Vſhers, Bayliffs, Groomes, and Porters, who have all the authoritie of ordering the affairs of their Lords houſe in their hands. There is not a key left in the Queens hand of any office, but onely of power and libertie to call for what ſhe wanteth accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Kings royall allowance: which if ſhe exceed, the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have power to reſtrain her by order from the King. But coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey huſwives, and poore mens wives, whoſe husbands have no Officers, Bayliffs or Stewards, to overſee and order their eſtates, they may carry the keyes of any office at their own girdles, which the husband keepeth not in his own hand. Not becauſe poore huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wives have greater authoritie in the houſe then Queens; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their poverty and mean eſtate, they are fain to be in ſtead of many ſervants to their husbands.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. The whole body naturall, is the firſt ſubject of all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power of any member in the body; as the facultie of ſight is firſt in the body, before in the eye.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is not in the myſticall body (the Church) in all reſpects alike, as in the naturall body. In the naturall body there be all the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:196745:25"/>faculties of each part actually inexiſtent, though not exerting or putting forth themſelves, till each member be articulated and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. But in the body of the Church of Brethren it is not ſo. All the ſeverall functions of Church power, are not actually inexiſtent in the body of Brethren, unleſſe ſome of them have the gifts of all the officers, which often they have not, having neither Presbyters, nor men fit to be Presbyters. Now if the power of the Presbytery were given to a particular Church of Brethren, as ſuch, <hi>primo &amp; per ſe,</hi> then it would be found in every particular Church of Brethren. For a <hi>Quatenus adomnia valet conſequentia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 4. But it is an uſuall tenent in many of our beſt Divines, that the government of the Church is mixt of a Monarchy, an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocracie, and a Democracy. In regard of Chriſt the head, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church is ſoveraigne and monarchicall. In regard of the Rule by the Presbytery, it is ſtewardly and Ariſtocraticall: in regard of the peoples power in elections and cenſures, it is Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall: which argueth, the people have ſome ſtock of <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, power and authority in the government of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> In a large ſenſe, Authority after a ſort, may be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the people. As 1. when a man acteth by counſell accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own diſcerning freely, he is then ſaid to be <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Dominus ſui actus.</hi> So the people in all the acts of liberty which they put forth are <hi>Domini ſui actus,</hi> Lords of their own action.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The people by their acts of liberty, as in election of officers, and concurrency in cenſure of offenders, and in the Determination and Promulgation of Synodall acts; they have a great ſtroke or power in the ordering of Church affairs, which may be called <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtas,</hi> a POWER, which many times goeth under the name of rule or authoritie, but in proper ſpeech it is rather a priviledge or liberty then authoritie, as hath been opened above in Chap. 3. For no act of the peoples power or liberty doth properly bind, unleſſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Presbytery concur with it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third argument whereby it may appear that the Elders of a particular Church are the firſt ſubject of authoritie in that Church, is taken from the like removall of other ſubjects, from whence they might be thought to derive their authoritie, as was uſed before to prove the Church of Brethren was the firſt ſubject of their own li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in their own Congregation. The Elders of Churches are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found in Scripture to derive their authority which they exerciſe in their own congregation, either from the Elders of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:196745:25"/>or from any Synod of Churches. All particular Churches and all the Elders of them are of equall power, each of them reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their own Congregations. None of them call others their Rabbies, or Maſters, or Fathers (in reſpect of any authoritie over them) but all of them own and acknowledge one another as fellow Brethren, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>And though in a Synod they have received power from Chriſt, and from his preſence in the Synod, to exerciſe Authoritie in impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing burthens (ſuch as the holy Ghoſt layeth) upon all Churches whoſe Elders are preſent with them, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28. (for the Apoſtles were Elders in all Churches) yet the Elders of every particular Church, when they walk with the brethren of their own Church in light and peace, they need not to derive from the Synod any power to impoſe the ſame, or the like burthens upon their owne Churches. For they have received a power and charge from Chriſt, to teach and command with all authoritie the whole counſell of God unto their people. And the people diſcerning the light of the truth delivered, and walking in peace with their Elders, they readily yeeld obedience to their Over-ſeers, in whatſoever they ſee and hear by them commended to them from the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Now we come to the <hi>third branch</hi> of the third Propoſition, which was this. That the Church of a particular congregation, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Brethren walking and joyning together in truth and peace, are the firſt ſubject of all Church-power, needfull to be exerciſed within themſelves, whether in the election or ordination of officers, or in the cenſure of offenders in their own body.</p>
               <p>The truth hereof may appear by theſe Arguments. 1 In point of <hi>ordination.</hi> From the compleat integritie of a Miniſters calling (oven to the ſatisfaction of his own and the peoples conſcience) when both the Brethren and the Elders of the particular Church whereto he is called, have put forth the power which belongeth to them about him. As, when the Brethren of the Church have choſen him to office, and the Presbyterie of the Church have laied their hands upon him: and both of them in their ſeverall acts have due reſpect to the inward miniſteriall gifts whereunto God hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him: he may then look at himſelf as called by the holy Ghoſt, to exerciſe his talents in that office amongſt them, and the people may and ought to receive him, as ſent of God to them.</p>
               <p>What defect may be found in ſuch a call, when the Brethren ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their lawfull libertie, and the Elders their lawfull authority,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:196745:26"/>in his ordination, and nothing more is required to the compleat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of a Miniſters calling? If it be ſaid there wanted impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands by the Biſhop, who ſucceedeth in the place of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> whom the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> left the one in Epheſus, the other in Crete, to ordain Elders in many Churches. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Touching ordination by <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and (upon pretence of them) by Biſhops, enough hath been ſaid by many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned heretofore, eſpecially of later times.</p>
               <p>The ſumme cometh to theſe concluſions. 1 That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> did not ordain Elders in many Churches, as Biſhops, but as Evangeliſts. <hi>Timothy</hi> is expreſly termed an Evangeliſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. And <hi>Titus</hi> is as clearly decyphered to be an Evangeliſt as <hi>Timothy,</hi> by the characters of an Evangeliſt, which either Scripture holdeth forth, or <hi>Euſebius</hi> noteth in his <hi>Eccleſiaſt. hiſtor. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 37. <hi>Gr. cap.</hi> 31. <hi>Lat.</hi> Not to be limited to a certain Church, but to follow the Apoſtles, finiſhing their work in planting and watering Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, where they came. They did indeed ordain officers where they wanted, and exerciſed juriſdiction (as the Apoſtles did) in ſeverall Churches; yet with the reſt of the Presbyterie, and in the preſence of the whole Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. But for the continuance of this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of an Evangeliſt in the Church, there is no direction in the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles either to <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus,</hi> or any where elſe in Scripture.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concluſion. Thoſe Biſhops whoſe callings or offices in the Church, are ſet forth in thoſe Epiſtles to be continued; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Synonyma with Presbyters. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. to 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Concluſ. We read of many Biſhops to one Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23. and Chap. 20.17, 28. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5.7. but not of many Churches (much leſſe all the Churches in a large Dioceſſe) to one Biſhop.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Concluſ. There is no tranſcendent proper work, cut out, or reſerved for ſuch a tranſcendent officer as a Dioceſan Biſhop through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the New Teſtament. The tranſcendent acts reſerved to him by the Advocates of Epiſcopacie, are Ordination and Iuriſdiction. Now both theſe are acts of Rule. And <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth no Rulers in the Church above Paſtors and Teachers, who labour in word and doctrine, but rather Paſtors and Teachers above them. The Elders (ſaith he) that rule well, are worthy of double honour, but eſpecially they that labour in word and doctrine. 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Concluſ. When after the Apoſtles times, one of the Paſtors by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:196745:26"/>way of eminencie was called Biſhop for order ſake, yet for many yeers he did no act of power, but 1 With conſent of the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. 2 With conſent, and in the preſence of the people. As is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of <hi>Euſebius, Eccleſiaſt. Hiſtor. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>ca.</hi> 43. <hi>Gr. ca.</hi> 35. <hi>Lat.

               <p>When it is alledged out of <hi>Hiereme</hi> to confirm the ſame, that in the primitive times, <hi>Communi Presbyterorum conſilie, Eceleſiae guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabantur.</hi> It is a weak and poore evaſion, to put it off with obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that he ſaith, <hi>Communi Presbyterorum conſilie,</hi> not <hi>authoritate.</hi> For 1. No authoritie is due to Presbyters over the Biſhop or Paſtor, no more then to the Paſtor over them. They are <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Elders, and coequall in authoritie. And 2. when <hi>Hiereme</hi> ſaith, The Churches were governed by the common counſell, but all with it, elſe it might be ſaid, the Biſhop governed the Churches with the common counſell of Presbyters, to wit, asked, but not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. And that would imply a contradiction to <hi>Hieronus</hi> teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to ſay the Churches were governed by the ſole authoritie of Biſhops, and yet not without asking the common counſell of the Presbyters. For in asking their counſell, and not following it, the Biſhop ſhould order and govern the Churches againſt their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell. Now that the Churches were governed by the common counſell of Presbyters, and againſt the common counſell of Presbyters, are flat contradictories.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For a ſecond Argument, to prove that the Brethren of the Church of a particular congregation, walking with their Elders in truth and peace, are the firſt ſubject of all that Church power which is needfull to be exerciſed in their own body: It is taken</p>
               <p>From their indiſpenſable and independent power in Church cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The cenſure that is ratified in heaven cannot be diſpenſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, nor reverſed by any power on earth. Now the cenſure that is adminiſtred by the Church of a particular congregation, is ratified in Heaven. For ſo ſaith the Lord Ieſus touching the power of Church cenſures, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18 17, 18. If the offender refuſe <hi>to hear the Church, let him be to thee as a heathen and a Publican. Verily I ſay unto you Whatſoever ye ſhall bind onearth, ſhall be bound in Heaven: and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this Argument from this Text many objections are wont to be made, but none that will hold.</p>

It was enough the Apoſtles looked for a Church which Chriſt would gather, and build upon the confeſſion of <hi>Peters</hi> faith; and being built, ſhould be indued with heavenly power in their cenſures, which they more fully underſtood after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when having received the Holy Ghoſt, they came to put theſe things in practice.</p>

The alluſion in the Church-cenſure to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, in accounting a man as an <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Publican,</hi> doth not argue that Chriſt directeth his Diſciples to complain of ſcandals to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues; but only directeth them how to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obſtinate offenders, excommunicate by the Chriſtian church, to wit, to walk towards them, as the <hi>Jews</hi> walk towards <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> (to wit, denying to them religious communion) and as to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Publicans,</hi> with-holding from them familiar civill commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; for ſo the <hi>Iews</hi> ſaid to Chriſts Diſciples, <hi>Why eateth your Maſter with Publicans and Sinners?</hi>

For it was his meaning and purpoſe in this place, to preſcribe a rule for the removing of all ſcandals out of the Church, which cannot be done by telling the Church of one Congregation; for what if an Elder offend; yea, what if the whole Presbytery offend? The people or Brethren have not power to judge their Judges, to rule their Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Yea, what if the whole Congregation fall under an offence (as they may do, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.13.) a Synod of many Presbyters may reform them, but ſo cannot any one Congregation alone; if the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that gave the offence ſtand out in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Reſerving due honour to Synods rightly ordered, or (which is all one) a <hi>Claſſis</hi> or <hi>Convention</hi> of Presbyters of particular churches, we do not finde that a Church is any where put for a Synod of Presbyteries. And it were very incongruous in this place: For though it be faid a particular Congregation cannot reach the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movall of all offences; ſo it may be as truly ſaid, that it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to trouble Synods with every offence that falleth out in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; Offences fall out often, Synods meet but ſeldome; and when they do meet, they finde many more weighty imployments, then to attend to every offence of every private brother. Beſides, as an whole particular Congregation may offend, ſo may a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Aſſembly of all the Presbyters in a Nation offend alſo: For ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councels have erred; and what remedy ſhall be found to remove ſuch errors and offences out of this Text? Moreover, if an offence be found in a Brother of a Congregation, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation be found faithfull and willing to remove it by due cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; why ſhould the offence be called up to more publike judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the plaiſter made broader than the ſore?</p>
               <p>Again, If an Elder offend, the reſt of the Presbytery with the Congregation joyning together, may proceed againſt him, (if they cannot otherwiſe heal him) and ſo remove the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:196745:28"/>from amongſt them. If the whole Presbyterie offend, or ſuch, a part as will draw a party and a faction in the Church with them their readieſt courſe is, to bring the matter then to a Synod. For though this place in <hi>Matthew</hi> direct not to that; yet the Holy Ghoſt leaveth us not without direction in ſuch a caſe, but giveth us a pattern in the church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to repaire to a Synod. And the like courſe is to be taken in the offence of a whole Congregation, if it be perſiſted in with obſtinacy. Neither is it true which was ſaid, that it was the purpoſe of Chriſt in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. to preſcribe a rule for the removall of all offences out of the Church; but only of ſuch private and leſſe hainous offences, as grow publike and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous only by obſtinacy of the offenders: For if offences be haynous and publike at firſt, the Holy Ghoſt doth not direct us to proceed in ſuch a generall courſe from a private admonition by one brother alone, and then to a ſecond, by one or two more, and at laſt, to tell it to the Church. But in ſuch a caſe the Apoſtle giveth another rule, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11.) to caſt an haynous notorious offender, both out of church-communion, and private familiar communion alſo.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> The contentions in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> were not the offence of a private brother, but of the whole church. And who can tell whether they had not ſpoken of it to the Church before? But whether thay had or no, the example only argueth, that Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren offended with the ſins of their brethren, may tell an Elder of the church of it, that he may tell it to the Church, which no man denyeth. <hi>Paul</hi> was an Elder of every church of Chriſt, as the other Apoſtles were, as having the government of all the churches com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them all.</p>
               <p>Having thus (by the help of Chriſt) cleered this Text in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. from variety of miſconſtructions, (which not the obſcurity of the words, but the eminency of the gifts, and worth of Expoſitors hath made difficult) Let us adde an argument or two more to the ſame purpoſe, to prove, that the Church of a particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, fully furniſhed with officers, and rightly walking in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and peace, is the firſt ſubject of all Church-authority, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be exerciſed within their own body.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A third argument to prove this, is uſually and juſtly taken from the practice and example of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> in the excommunication of the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.1. to 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 1. The excommunication of the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian,</hi> was not an act of judiciall authority in the church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> whether Elders or Brethren, but rather an act of ſubjection to the Apoſtle, publiſhing the ſentence, which the Apoſtle had before decreed and judged: for (ſaith the Apoſtle) I though abſent in body, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in ſpirit, have judged already, concerning him that hath done this deed, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Paul</hi> (as a chiefe Officer of every church) judged before-hand the excommunication of the inceſtuous <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian:</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:196745:29"/>yet his judgement was not a judiciall ſentence, delivering him to Satan, but a judicious doctrine and inſtruction, teaching the Church what they ought to do in that caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The act of the church in <hi>Corinth</hi> in cenſuring the inceſtuous perſon, was indeed an act of ſubjection to the Apoſtles divine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and direction (as all church-cenſures, by whomſoever admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, ought to be acts of ſubjection to the word of Chriſt) but yet their act was a compleat act of juſt power, (even an act of all that liberty and authority which is to be put forth in any cenſure.) For, firſt they delivered him to Satan, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and with the power of the Lord Jeſus, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and that is the higheſt power in the Church. Secondly, the ſpirit of <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike ſpirit was gathered together with them, in delivering and publiſhing the ſentence; which argueth, both his power and theirs was co-incident and concurrent in this ſentence. Thirdly, the holy end and uſe of this ſentence argueth the heavenly power from whence it proceeded. They delivered him to Satan for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the fleſh (that is, for the mortifying of his corruption) that his ſoul might be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus. Fourthly, when his ſoul came to be humble and penitent by the means of this ſentence, <hi>Paul</hi> intreateth the church to releaſe and forgive him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. to 10.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If the Presbyterie alone had put forth this power, yet that ſufficeth to make good the Propoſition, that every church fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a presbyterie, and proceeding righteouſly and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, they have within themſelves ſo much power as is requiſite, to be exerciſed within their own body.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. It is apparent by the Text, that the Brethren concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red alſo in this ſentence, and that with <hi>ſome act of power,</hi> to wit, ſuch power as the want of putting it forth, retarded the ſentence, and the putting of it forth was requiſite to the adminiſtration of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>For, firſt, the reproofe for not proceeding to ſentence ſooner, is directed to the whole church, as well as to the Presbyterie; <hi>They are all blamed for not mourning, for not putting him away, for being puffed up rather,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.2.</p>

Chriſt hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing againſt the <hi>Church of Pergamus,</hi> for <hi>ſuffering Balaam</hi> and the <hi>Nicolaitans,</hi> Revel. 2.14, 15. and ſomething againſt the <hi>Church of Thyatira,</hi> for <hi>ſuffering Jezabel.</hi> Now if theſe Churches had not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them ſufficient power to purge out their own offenders, why are they blamed for toleration of them? yea, why are not the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Churches blamed for the ſins of theſe Churches?

               <p>It is an unſound body that wanteth ſtrength to purge out his own vicious and malignant humours. And every Church of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation, being a bodie, even a body of Chriſt in it ſelf, it were not for the honour of Chriſt, nor of his body, if when it were in a ſound and athletick conſtitution, it ſhould not have power to purge it ſelf of its own ſuperfluous and noyſome humors.</p>

If then the church, or a conſiderable part of it fall into error through ignorance, or into faction by variance, they cannot expect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt with them, according to his promiſe to paſſe a bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſentence. And then as they fall under the conviction and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of any other ſiſter church, in a way of brotherly love, by vertue of communion of churches; ſo their errors and variance, and whatſoever ſcandals elſe do accompany the ſame, they are juſtly ſubject to the condemnation of a Synod of churches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A ſecond Argument to prove that a Synod is the firſt ſubject of power, to determine and judge errors and variances in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar churches, is taken from the pattern ſet before us in that caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1. to 28. when certain falſe Teachers, having taught in the church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> a neceſſity of circumciſion to ſalvation, and having gotten a faction to take part with them, (as appeareth by the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  </gap> of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> againſt them) the church did not determine the caſe themſelves, but referred the whole matter to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem, Act.</hi> 15.1, 2. Not to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> alone, but to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> The Apoſtles were as the Elders and Rulers of all churches; and the Elders there were not a few, the Believers in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> being many thouſands. Neither did the Apoſtles determine the matter (as hath been ſaid) by Apoſtolicall authority from immediate revelation; but they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled together with the Elders, to <hi>conſider of the matter, v. 6.</hi> and a <hi>multitude of Brethren</hi> together with them (<hi>v.</hi> 12.22, 23.) and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſearching out the cauſe by an ordinary means of <hi>diſputation, v.</hi> 7. <hi>Peter</hi> cleered it by the witneſſe of the Spirit to his Miniſtery in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his family; <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> by the like effect of their

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Iames</hi> confirmed the ſame by the teſtimony of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> wherewith the whole Synod being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, they determine of a judiciall ſentence, and of a way to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it by letters and meſſengers; in which they <hi>cenſure the falſe Teachers, as troublers of their Church, and ſubverters of their ſoules;</hi> they reject the impoſition of <hi>circumciſion, as a yoak which neither they nor their fathers were able to beare:</hi> they impoſe upon the churches none but ſome <hi>neceſſary</hi> obſervations, and them by way of that authority which the Lord had given them, <hi>v.</hi> 28. Which pattern cleerly ſheweth us to whom the <hi>key of authority</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, when there groweth offence and difference in a church. Look as in the caſe of the offence of a faithfull brother perſiſted in, the matter is at laſt judged and determined in a church, which is a Congregation of the faithfull: ſo in the caſe of the offence of the church or congregation, the matter is at laſt judged in a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of churches, a Church of churches: for what is a Synod elſe but a Church of churches?</p>
               <p>Now, from all theſe former <hi>Propoſitions</hi> which tend to cleare the <hi>firſt ſubject</hi> of the power of the keys, it may be eaſie to deduce certain <hi>corollaries</hi> from thence, tending to clear a parallel Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to this; to wit, <hi>In what ſenſe it may, and ought to be admitted, that a church of a particular congregation is independent in the uſe of the power of the keys, and in what ſenſe not?</hi> For in what ſenſe the Church of a particular congregation is the firſt ſubject of the power of the keys, in the ſame ſenſe it is independent, and in none other. We taking the firſt ſubject and the independent ſubject to be all one.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Corollary.</hi> The Church is not independent on Chriſt, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on him for all church-power.</p>
               <p>The Reaſon is plain, becauſe he is the firſt ſubject of all church-power by way of ſoveraigne eminency, as hath been ſaid. And therefore the church, and all the Officers thereof; yea, and a Synod of churches is dependent upon him, for all miniſteriall church-power. <hi>Miniſtery is dependent upon ſoveraigntie;</hi> yea, the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent they be upon Chriſt, in all the exerciſe of their church-power, the more powerfull is all their power in all their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſtrations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Corollary.</hi> The firſt ſubject of the miniſteriall power of the keys, though it be independent in reſpect of derivation of power from the power of the ſword to the performance of any ſpirituall
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:196745:32"/>adminiſtration, yet it is ſubject to the power of the ſword in matters which concern the civill peace.</p>
               <p>The matters which concern the civill peace, wherein Church-ſubjection is chiefly attended, are of foure ſorts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt ſort be <hi>civill matters,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the <hi>things of this life,</hi> as is the diſpoſing of mens goods or lands, lives, or liberties, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, cuſtomes, worldly honours, and inheritances. In theſe the Church ſubmitteth, and referreth it ſelf to the civill State. Chriſt as miniſter of the circumciſion, refuſed to take upon him the dividing of Inheritances amongſt Brethren, as impertinent to his calling, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.13, 14. <hi>His kingdome</hi> (he acknowledgeth) <hi>is not of this world,</hi> Joh. 18.36. Himſelf payed tribute to <hi>Ceſar,</hi> (Matth. 17.27.) for himſelf and his diſciples.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of things which concern civill peace, is, the <hi>eſtabliſhment of pure Religion, in doctrine, worſhip, and government,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God: as alſo the reformation of all corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in any of theſe. On this ground the good Kings of Iudah, commanded <hi>Iudah to ſeek the Lord God of their fathers,</hi> and to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, according to his own ſtatutes and commandments: and the contrary corruptions of ſtrange gods, high places, Images, and Groves, they removed, and are commended of God, and obeyed by the Prieſts and people in ſo doing, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.8. to 16. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.6. to 9. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.3, 4. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.4, 5, 6. 8, 9, 10. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.3. to 35. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.1. to 12. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.3. to 33. The eſtabliſhment of pure Religion, and the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of corruptions in Religion, do much concerne the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill peace. If Religion be corrupted, there will be <hi>warre in the gates,</hi> Iudg. 5.8. and <hi>no peace to him, that cometh in, or goeth out.</hi> 2 Chron. 15.3, 5, 6. But where Religion rejoyceth, the civill State flouriſheth, <hi>Hagg.</hi> 2.15. to 19. It is true, the eſtabliſhment of pure Religion, and reformation of corruptions pertain alſo to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Synodicall Aſſemblies. But they go about it onely with ſpirituall weapons, miniſtery of the Word, and Church-cenſures upon ſuch as are under Church-power. But Magiſtrates addreſſe themſelves thereto, partly by commanding, and ſtirring up the Churches and Miniſters thereof to go about it in their ſpirituall way: partly alſo by civill puniſhments upon the wilfull oppoſers, and diſturbers of the ſame. As <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> ſent <hi>Prieſts and Levites</hi> (and them accompanied and countenanced with <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi>) to <hi>preach and teach in the Cities of Iudah,</hi> 2 Chron. 17.7, 8, 9. So
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:196745:32"/>
                  <hi>Ioſiah</hi> put to death the idolatrous Prieſts of the high places, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22.20. Nor was that a peculiar duty or priviledge of the <hi>Kings of Iudah,</hi> but attended to alſo by <hi>heathen Princes,</hi> and that to prevent the wrath of God, againſt the Realme <hi>of the King and his ſons.</hi> Ezra 7.23. yea, and of the times of the New Teſtament it is propheſied, that in ſome caſes, capitall puniſhment ſhall proceed againſt <hi>falſe Prophets,</hi> and that by the procurement of their <hi>neereſt kindred.</hi> Zach. 13.3. And the execution thereof is deſcribed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.4. to 7. where the <hi>rivers and fountains of waters</hi> (that is, the Prieſts and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, that conveigh the Religion of the Sea of Rome throughout the countreys) <hi>are turned to blood,</hi> that is, have <hi>blood given them to drink,</hi> by the civill Magiſtrate.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, though we willingly acknowledge a power in the Civill Magiſtrate, to eſtabliſh and reform Religion, according to the Word of God: yet we would not be ſo underſtood, as if we judged it to belong to the civill power, to compell all men to come and ſit down at the Lords table, or to enter into the communion of the Church, before they be in ſome meaſure prepared of God for ſuch fellowſhip. For this is not <hi>a Reformation,</hi> but a <hi>Deformation</hi> of the Church, and is not according to the Word of God, but againſt it, as we ſhall ſhow (God willing) in the ſequell, when we come to ſpeak of the diſpoſition or qualification of Church-members.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a third ſort of things which concern the civill peace, wherein the Church is not to refuſe ſubjection to the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, in the exerciſe of ſome publick ſpirituall adminiſtrations, which may advance and help forward the publick good of Civill State according to God. In time of warre, or peſtilence, or any publick calamitie or danger lying upon a Common-wealth, the Magiſtrate may lawfully <hi>proclaime a Faſt as Iehoſaphat did,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.3. and the Churches ought not to neglect ſuch an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon ſuch a juſt occaſion. Neither doth it impeach the power of the Church to call a Faſt, when themſelves ſee God calling them to publick humiliation. For as <hi>Iehoſaphat</hi> called a Faſt: ſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Joel</hi> ſtirreth up the Prieſts to call a Faſt in time of a famine threatning the want of holy Sacrifices, <hi>Ioel</hi> 1.13, 14.</p>
               <p>It may fall out alſo, that in undertaking a warre, or in making a league with a forraine State, there may ariſe ſuch caſes of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as may require the conſultation of a Synod. In which caſe, or the like, if the Magiſtrate call for a Synod, the Churches are to yeeld him ready ſubjection herein in the Lord. <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> though he
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:196745:33"/>was out of his place, when he was in <hi>Samaria</hi> viſiting an idolatrous King: yet he was not out of his way, when in caſe of undertaking the war againſt <hi>Syria,</hi> he called for counſell from the mouth of the Lord, by a Councell or Synod of Prieſts and Prophets. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22.5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth ſort of thinge, wherein the church is not to refuſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the <hi>Civill Magiſtrate,</hi> is in patient ſuffering their unjuſt perſecutions without hoſtile or rebellious reſiſtance. For though perſecution of the churches and ſervants of Chriſt will not advance the civill peace, but overthrow it; yet for the church to take up the ſword in her own defence, is not a lawfull means of preſerving the church peace, but a diſturbance of it rather. In this caſe, when <hi>Peter</hi> drew his ſword in defence of his Maſter, (<hi>the Lord Ieſus</hi>) againſt an attachment ſerved upon him, by the Officers of the high Prieſts and Elders of the people: our Saviour bade him <hi>put up his ſword into his ſheath again;</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>all they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh by the ſword,</hi> Mat. 27.50, 51, 52. where he ſpeaketh of <hi>Peter,</hi> either as a private Diſciple, or a church-officer, to whom, though the power of the keys was committed, yet the power of the ſword was not committed. And for ſuch to take up the ſword, though in the cauſe of Chriſt, it is forbidden by Chriſt; and ſuch is the caſe of any particular church or of a Synod of churches. As they have received the power of the keys, not of the ſword, to the power of the keys they may, and ought to adminiſter, but not of the ſword. Wherein nevertheleſſe, we ſpeak of churches and Synods, as ſuch, that is, as church-members, or church-aſſemblies, acting in a church-way, by the power of the keys received from Chriſt. But if ſome of the ſame perſons be alſo betruſted by the civill State, with the preſervation and protection of the Lawes and Liberties, peace and ſafety of the ſame ſtate, and ſhall meet together in a publike ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill aſſembly (whether in Councell or Camp) they may there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by civill power (according to the wholſome lawes and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the countrey) <hi>Ne quid Eccleſia, ne quid Reſpublica detrimenti capiat.</hi> If King <hi>Saul</hi> ſwear to put <hi>Ionathan</hi> to death, the Leaders of the people may by ſtrong hands reſcue him from his fathers unjuſt and illegall fury. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.44, 45. But if <hi>Saul</hi> perſecute <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> (though as unjuſtly as <hi>Ionathan</hi>) yet if the Princes and Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the people will not reſcue him from the wrath of the King, <hi>David</hi> (a private man) will not draw out his ſword in his own defence, ſo much as to <hi>touch the Lords anoynted,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.4. to 7.</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:196745:33"/>
               <p>To conclude this <hi>Corollary,</hi> touching the ſubjection of churches to the civill State, in matters which concern the civill peace, this may not be omitted, that as the Church is ſubject to the ſword of the Magiſtrate in things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the civill peace: ſo the Magiſtrate (if Chriſtian) is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the keys of the Church, in matters which concern the peace of his conſcience and the kingdome of heaven. Hence it is propheſied by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that Kings and Queens, who are nurſing fathers and mothers to the church, <hi>ſhall bow down to the Church, with their faces to the earth,</hi> Iſai. 49.23. that is, they ſhall walk in profeſſed ſubjection to the Ordinances of Chriſt in his Church. Hence alſo it is, that <hi>David</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieth of <hi>a two-edged ſword,</hi> (that is, the ſword of the Spirit, the word of Chriſt) put <hi>into the hands of the Saints</hi> (who are by calling the Members of the Church) as to ſubdue the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the miniſtery of the Word, to the obedience of the Goſpel (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.6, 7.) ſo <hi>to binde their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters of iron, to execute upon them the judgement written,</hi> (that is, written in the Word) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149. <hi>v.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="3">3. A <hi>third Corollary</hi> touching the independency of churches is this, That a church of a particular Congregation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Elders and Brethren, and walking in the truth and peace of the Goſpel, as it is the Firſt ſubject of all Church-power, needfull to be exerciſed within it ſelfe, ſo it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent upon any other (Church or Synod) for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the ſame.</p>
               <p>That ſuch a Church is the firſt ſubject of all church-power, hath been cleered above in the opening the third Propoſition of the firſt ſubject of the power of the keys. And ſuch a church being the firſt ſubject of church-power, is unavoidably inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon any other church or body for the exerciſe therof, for as hath been ſaid afore, the firſt ſubject of any Accident or Adjunct, is independent upon any other either for the injoying, or for the imploying (the having or the uſing) of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A <hi>fourth Corollary</hi> touching the independency of churches is, That a Church fallen into any offence (whether it be the whole church, or a ſtrong party in it) is not independent in the exerciſe of church-power, but is ſubject both to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of any other church, and to the <hi>determination and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:196745:34"/>judiciall ſentence</hi> of a Synod for <hi>direction into a way of truth and peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this alſo ariſeth from the former diſcourſe. For, if <hi>clavis errans non ligat, &amp; Eccleſia litigans non ligat;</hi> that is, if Chriſt hath not given to a particular church a promiſe to binde and looſe in heaven, what they binde and looſe on earth, unleſſe they <hi>agree together,</hi> and <hi>agree in his name,</hi> then ſuch a church is not independent in their proceedings, as do fail in either. For all the independency that can be claimed is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon that promiſe, <hi>What yee binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven: what yee looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven,</hi> Matth. 18.18. On that promiſe is founded both the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and <hi>ſecurity,</hi> and <hi>parity</hi> alſo of all churches. But if that promiſe be cut off from them, they are like <hi>Samſon</hi> when his haire was cut off, weak, and ſubject to fall under other men; and yet they fall ſofter then hee did: hee fell into the hands of his enemies, but they fall under the cenſure of their friends. As the falſe Prophet recanting his error did acknowledge, ſo may they: <hi>Thus was I wounded in the houſe of my friends,</hi> Zach. 13.6. In the houſe of a neighbour-church or two, I was friendly ſmitten with a brotherly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, which (like <hi>a precious oyle</hi>) did <hi>not break mine head:</hi> and in the houſe of a Synod of churches, I was friendly, yea, brotherly cenſured and healed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. A <hi>fifth</hi> and laſt <hi>Corollary</hi> ariſing from the former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, touching the independency of churches, may be this; Though the church of a particular Congregation, conſiſting of Elders and Brethren, and walking with a right foot in the truth and peace of the Goſpel, be the firſt ſubject of all church-power needfull to be exerciſed within it ſelfe; and conſequently be independent from any other church or Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod in the uſe of it; yet it is a ſafe and whole ſome, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ordinance of Chriſt, for ſuch particular churches to joyn together in holy Covenant or Communion, and conſolation amongſt themſelves, to adminiſter all their church affairs, (which are of weighty, and difficult and common concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) not without common conſultation and conſent of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther churches about them. Now church-affaires of weighty and difficult and common concernment, wee account to be
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:196745:34"/>the <hi>election and ordination of Elders, excommunication of an Elder,</hi> or any <hi>perſon of publick note,</hi> and employment: the <hi>tranſlation of an Elder</hi> from one Church to another, or the like. In which caſe we conceive it ſafe and wholſome, and an holy ordinance to proceed with common conſultation and conſent. Safe, for <hi>in multitude of counſellers there is ſafetie</hi> (as in civill, ſo in Church affairs) Prov. 11.14. And though this or that Church may be of a good and ſtrong conſtitution, and walk with a right foot in the truth, and peace of the Goſpel: yet all Churches are not in a like athletick plight, and they will be Ioath to call in, or look out for help as much or more then others, though they have more need then others: yea, and the beſt Churches may ſoon degenerate, and ſtand in as much need of help as others, and for want of it may ſink and fall into deep Apoſtaſie, which other Churches might have prevented, had they diſcerned it at firſt.</p>
               <p>It is alſo wholſome, as tending to maintain brotherly love, and ſoundneſſe of doctrine in Churches, and to prevent many offences, which may grow up in this or that particular Church, when it tranſacteth all ſuch things within it ſelf without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>It is likewiſe an holy ordinance of Chriſt, as having juſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from a like precedent. The Apoſtles were as much inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent from one another, and ſtood in as little need of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others help, as Churches do one of another. And yet <hi>Paul</hi> went up to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> to confer with <hi>Peter, Iames and Iohn,</hi> leſt he <hi>ſhould run in vain</hi> in the courſe of his miniſtery, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2.2. And though in conference the chief Apoſtles added nothing to <hi>Paul,</hi> ver. 6. yet when they perceived <hi>the Goſpel of the uncircumciſion was committed to Paul and Barnabas, as that of the circumciſion to Peter, Iames and Iohn, they gave</hi> unto one another <hi>the right hand of fellowſhip.</hi> ver. 9. Now then it will follow by juſt proportion, that if the Apoſtles who are each of them independent one of another, had need to conſult and confer together about the work of their miniſtery, to procure the freer paſſage to their calling, and to their doctrine: then ſurely Churches, and Elders of Churches, though independent one of another, had need to communicate their courſes and proceedings in ſuch caſes one with another, to procure the freer paſſage to the ſame. And if
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:196745:35"/>the Apoſtles, giving right hand of fellowſhip one to another, did mutually ſtrengthen their hands in the work of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: then the Elders of Churches, giving right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip to one another in their ordination, or upon any fit oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, cannot but much encourage and ſtrengthen the hearts and hands of one another in the Lords work.</p>
               <p>Again, ſomething might be added, if not for confirmation, yet for illuſtration of this point, by comparing the dimenſions of <hi>the new Ieruſalem,</hi> which is a perfect platform of a pure Church, as it ſhall be conſtituted in the Iewiſh Church ſtate, at their laſt converſion. The dimenſions of this Church as they are deſcribed by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> (Chap. 48.30.) are (according to <hi>Iunius</hi>) <hi>twelve furlongs,</hi> which after the meaſure of the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie (which is double to the common) is about <hi>three miles</hi> in length, and as much in breadth. But the dimenſions of the ſame Church of the <hi>Iews,</hi> in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.16. is ſaid to be <hi>twelve thouſand furlongs.</hi> Now how can theſe two dimenſions of the ſame Church ſtand together, which are ſo farre diſcrepant one from another? For there be a <hi>thouſand times twelve</hi> furlongs, in <hi>twelve thouſand furlongs.</hi> The fitteſt and faireſt reconciliation ſeemeth plainly to be this, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaketh of the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of any ordinarie Iewiſh Church of one particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. But <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh of the dimenſions of many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Iewiſh Churches, combining together in ſome caſes, even to the communion of a thouſand Churches. Not that the Church of the Iews will be conſtituted in a <hi>Nationall</hi> and <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan</hi> frame, with <hi>Nationall</hi> officers, and <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops, or the like: but that ſometimes a thouſand of them will be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into a Synod, and all of them will have ſuch mutuall care, and yeeld ſuch mutuall brotherly help and communion one to another, as if they were all but one body.</p>
               <p>If any man ſay, <hi>Theologia ſymbolica,</hi> or <hi>parabolica non eſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentativa,</hi> that arguments from ſuch parables and myſticall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances in Scripture are not valid, let him enjoy his owne apprehenſion: and (if he can yeeld a better interpretation of the place) let him wave this collection. Nevertheleſſe, if there were no argumentative power in parables, why did the Lord Ieſus ſo much delight in that kind of teaching? and why did <hi>Iohn,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> deliver a great part of their
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:196745:35"/>propheſies in parables, if we muſt take them for riddles, and not for documents nor arguments? Surely if they ſerve not for argument, they ſerve not for document.</p>
               <p>But furthermore, touching this great work of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and conſociation of Churches, give us leave to adde this caution;<note place="margin">A Caution.</note> To ſee that this conſociation of Churches be not perverted, either to the oppreſſion or diminution of the juſt libertie and authoritie of each particular Church within it ſelf: who being well ſupplied with a faithfull and expert Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie of their own, do walk in their integritie according to the truth and peace of the Goſpel. Let Synods have their juſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie in all Churches, how pure ſoever, in determining ſuch <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as are requiſite for the edification of all Chriſts Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches according to God. <hi>But in the election and ordination of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and cenſure of offenders, let it ſuffice the Churches conſociate to aſſiſt one another, with their counſell, and right hand of fellowſhip, when they ſee a particular Church to uſe their libertie and power aright. But let them not put forth the power of their communitie, either to take ſuch Church acts out of their hands, or to hinder them in their lawfull courſe, unleſſe they ſee them (through ignorance or weakneſſe) to abuſe their libertie and authoritie in the Goſpel.</hi> All the liberties of Churches were purchaſed to them by the precious blood of the Lord Ieſus: and therefore neither may the Churches give them away, nor many Churches take them out of the hands of one. They may indeed prevent the abuſe of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and direct in the lawfull uſe of them, but not take them away, though themſelves ſhould be willing. The Lord Ieſus having given equall power to all the Apoſtles, it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for eleven of them to forbid the twelfth to do any act of his office without their intervention. Neither was it lawfull for the nine who were of inferiour gifts, to commit the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and command of all their Apoſtolick adminiſtrations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Peter, Iames and Iohn, who ſeemed to be pillars.</hi> And that, not onely becauſe they were all (one as well as another) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately guided by the holy Ghoſt: but becauſe they were all equall in office, and everie one to give account for himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
               <p>It is the like caſe (in ſome meaſure) of particular chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:196745:36"/>yea, there is moreover a three-fold further inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, which ſeemeth to us, to attend the tranſlation of the power of particular churches in theſe ordinary admniniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, into the hands of a Synod of Presbyters, commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>Claſſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. The promiſe of <hi>Binding and Looſing,</hi> in way of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, which Chriſt gave to every particular church (as hath been ſhewed) is by this means not received, nor injoyned, nor practiſed by themſelves immediately, but by their Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or Over-ſeers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame promiſe which was not given to Synods in acts of that nature (as hath been ſhewed in the Chapter of Synods) but in acts of another kinde, is hereby received, and injoyned, and practiſed by them, and by them onely, which ought not to be.</p>
               <p>And which is a third inconvenience, The practice of this power of the keys only by a Synod of Presbyters, ſtill keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Church as under nonage, as if they were not grown up to the full fruition of the juſt liberty of their riper yeers in the dayes of the Goſpel. For a mother to bear her young daughter in her arms, and not to ſuffer it to go on its own feet, whileſt it is in the infancie, is kindly and comely: but when the Damoſell is grown up to riper yeers, for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill to bear her in her arms, for fear of ſtumbling, it were an unceceſſary burthen to the mother, and a reproach to the Virgin; Such is the caſe here: The community of churches (according to the Hebrew phraſe) is as the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> each particular church is as the <hi>Daughter.</hi> In the old Teſtament, while the Church was in her nonage, it was not unſeaſonable to leave the whole guidance and bearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the hands of their <hi>Tutors and Governours, the Prieſts and Levites,</hi> and in the community of the nationall courts. But now in the dayes of the new Teſtament, when the churches are grown up (or ſhould be grown at leaſt) to more maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it were meet more to give the Church liberty to ſtand alone, and to walk upon her own legs; and yet in any ſuch part of her way, as may be more hard to hit right upon, as in her Elections, and Ordinances, and Cenſures of eminent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:196745:36"/>in office; it is a ſafe and holy and faithfull office of the vigilancy of the community of churches, to be preſent with them, and helpfull to them in the Lord. And at all times when a particular church ſhall wander out of the way, (whether out of the way of truth, or of peace) the community of churches may by no meanes be excuſed from reforming them again into their right way, according to the authority which the Lord hath given them for the publike edification of all the ſeverall churches within their Covenant.</p>
